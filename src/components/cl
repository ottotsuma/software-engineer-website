Dear Robert,

Please allow me to introduce myself, I am Shaun Darragh & I am a software engineer looking for my next adventure. I come from England and have been living in Japan for a few years now.

I started programming over 10 years ago now with VBA back in college in the UK, since then I have been working as a side job doing front-end with HTML, CSS and Javascript.Recently been the tech lead for a few projects with other developers the majority of my projects can be found at my GitHub : https://github.com/ottotsuma/

My preferred stack is ReactJS or VueJs with Nodejs, Express & MongoDB. I have experience with Ruby & SQL databases. 

Since moving to Japan I have worked in multicultural teams from all over the world, my last project contained two remote workers from South Africa and Mexico, alongside our Chinese, Japanese, English onsite staff. This project was called Munchify and was a mobile app for Andorid and iOS, made with react-native. 

I hope to hear about yourself some time, I know that you must be busy and I hope this message finds you well.

With gratitude,

Shaun
