    1: `The spell allows user to convert his magic caster levels into an equivalent number of warrior levels. By using that spell, he can temporarily become a half-baked level 100 warrior. It also carries the benefit of being able to use certain pieces of arms and armor that will normally require specific job classes to access without penalty. This includes freely utilizing any weapons and its abilities, which is seen during his fight with Shalltear. However, there are many drawbacks to that spell. The first weakness is that he cannot cast other spells while the magic is in effect. In addition, he will not gain any special warrior skills from the spell, and his recalculated ability scores will be lower than an actual warrior. Secondly, sustaining the transformation spell and other magic will both lower his mana and mana recovery rates to zero. This form is enough when matching blades with second-rate combatants like priests and the like, but he will stand no chance of winning against an opponent who is a dedicated warrior.`,
