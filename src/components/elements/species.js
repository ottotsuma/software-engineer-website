      Unlike a vampire, a ghoul is not affected by sunlight. Ghouls are stronger, faster and can see better than a human. But their main strength is their incredible healing abilities, they are even more impressive than a vampire's. Broken bones chunks of flesh will be instantly healed on the spot. Ghouls are most loyal to their maker, the main reason for this is because their maker's blood resides inside their body. The maker will need to supply the ghoul with his or her own blood otherwise the ghoul's body will start to deteriorate and eventually will cease to exist. As long as the ghoul gets a supply of the maker's blood then the ghoul will live on forever by the maker's side. The ghoul's loyalty is based on the amount of the maker's blood within them at the time. The function to eat regular food has completely disappeared. If the ghoul eats regular food, he or she will immediately vomit it. Instead, the undead must eat raw human flesh, with the initial turned ghoul can temporarily delay the hunger with raw animal meat. The ghoul's olfaction can detect if the meat is raw or not, with the former as a delicious smell. The faster a turned ghoul can consume different raw fresher human flesh (0/7), the faster and more likely better further evolution, such as the Wight.]
