// Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset because the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old lands but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal.

// The Elves and the republic have had at least 2 famous battles against each other.

// The new world is in a balance. 
// The Republic fractures from invasions by the Elves, late empire problems, uninterested ruling class, Alden invasion, Sea people sabotage.
// Alden invades Herkikia League, they both collapse under the sea peoples invasion.
// The Kingdom having become the Empire forms a deal with Niyosho but are both destroyed by the sea people
// Our characters flee though the desert/Solzi into Pocotcotco, who are under invasion by the Elves.
// Who again fall before the sea people in ruin.
