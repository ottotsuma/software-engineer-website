          <p>The next morning I found a note had been passed under my door.</p>
          <p id="Fancy">Dear Otto,</p>{" "}
          <p id="Fancy">
            Studying all the time is not good for you, let's go have some fun
            tonight! I'll wait for you in the garden of the big house. They will
            let you in, everyone there knows you by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The note had no name but it was clear who it was. I guess it was
            true the people around here did recognize me now. It was not like
            some of the other students in the academy though. The people here
            were kind to me. Maybe it was because I was the only Alden living
            here I did stand out a little bit. I guess I should go to class,
            then tell Ralsan at the farm I will be going back early. Even if she
            said to meet tonight I want to get ready, and maybe because I wanted
            to skip any chance of drawing more attention to myself. Ralsan said
            he would keep quiet but things got out of control really fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I washed my face and put on my school robe. The house I had moved
            into was really big, even my room was much bigger. The whole place
            smelt of wood all the time though, which was nice but meant I could
            not really use magic inside the house. The only other person living
            in the house was a kind middle aged man who made me breakfast
            everyday. He woke up early every day because he worked at the
            princesses house like Tsuma did. I said he did not have to make me
            breakfast but he always did and left it behind for me with a note
            saying it was for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ate and walked outside, one of the men that lived in the small
            village style they set up waved to me and shouted "You must of come
            home late last night I did not see you in the baths." Ah that,
            Leikan people bathed every night in public baths. At first it was
            really weird to me that they bathed together and every single night,
            but honestly I got over it pretty quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, I went to do some training by the arena. I have not given up
            on combat classes just the farming thing was just a hobby like I
            said before." I smiled and waved back as I headed to class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class today had been built up over the past few days. Last week
            Lubin had announced that the class were going to have duels to give
            an individual ranking for the class. This meant nothing on official
            records but would effect how the class treated each other, and who
            they would party up with in the future. Right now, I was the bottom
            of everyone's lists. At first it was just because I did not really
            join in any of the spell casting sections just mana-control
            practice. Then word got out that even during the lightning class I
            was not casting any spells. However shortly after these rumors
            started up that I was cursed. That was when I started to move down
            in peoples minds past not wanting to partner with me to avoiding me
            entirely. Maybe I should of done something about it, but instead of
            extra practice and combat classes I had joined the farming club so I
            had been so busy and tired I never really noticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a good thing it was just individual combat this time around
            and did not reflect on our records so I could just tap out at the
            start.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrived I sat by the window as the other students came in. I
            was never really late for classes, I was just in the habit of waking
            up early now. If I didn't the nosy neighbors would let themselves
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one sat next to me, but then again no one really paid attention
            to me. Maybe they were scared of me. If I was cursed they did not
            want to catch it. It's not like I was smelly or anything just the
            rumor that it was my fault people died in the tombs. I guess any
            student would be scared of someone like that when I think about it
            from their view.
          </p>
          <p>Lubin eventually arrived, a little late as always.</p>
          <p>
            "Okay we won't be in here long just a quick registration then down
            to the hall. It's good weather but another class is out there
            today." After that he shifted through the papers he had brought in he
            read through the list of class names again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The halls were used for clubs related to combat because the walls,
            floor and roof were built to be able to withstand spells. Well they
            were not built by Alden but who ever built the original buildings
            and have since then been used for that. The class went into the hall
            in cheers and egging each other on who was going to fight who and
            who was the strongest in our class. There was even one kid taking
            bets, the favorite being a girl called Sophie. She was from some
            minor house of something, honestly I had no interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Gather round, pick sticks from this pot and get into the group on
            that stick. Numbers one through six." Lubin shouted around the hall
            as he walked in. As always his instructions were short and to the
            point. You'd think he was busy but he left so much information out
            about the school I was starting to think he was just lazy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I picked the number three out on the end of my stick. The groups
            were made of 6 students each, our challenge was to fight matches
            against each other until each group had a champion then the
            champions would fight with all of the students watching. It felt
            like a pretty efficient way of doing it. Unlike the arena though
            there was no system to teleport us out when we became too damaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't kill each other, obviously. However you can injure each other
            and it is up to you to tap out in time. I will be moving around the
            room keeping an eye on everyone but I want the four of you not
            fighting to step in if one of your fellow students taps out. We are
            just practicing, none of this goes on any record and the purpose is
            just to learn from it not make enemies. Got it?" Lubin said from the
            middle of the hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class responded "Yes Sir." Like that the more domineering
            students told the others who they would fight or just challenged
            people in their group to fight them first. I was not picked to go
            first, Mila and Berta went first. Berta used water magic sending
            blobs of water at Mila followed up by thin fast shots of water. Mila
            at first did not really seem to be fighting back just trying to
            dodge the blows badly while muttering under her breath. Soon Berta
            broke out in sweat and started screaming holding her head and
            falling to her knees. I think Mila is a witch and cursed Berta.
            However Mila took one of the water shots in the stomach and also
            fell to her knees. She keeled over and started vomiting up blood.
          </p>
          {/*10,000 students per year. 36 students in a class, 278 classes? Well that is for the combat roles but not all students are combat. */}
          <p>
            "Take Mila to the medics and Berta to the priests. They are just
            outside the hall today in the courtyard, every combat class is doing
            this today." Lubin said to our group when Mila had fallen down. I
            was not sure who won but the other student marked down Berta as the
            winner. I guess it is a win like my first duel was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up was me and Max. I could not blame this on a fix because we
            drew straws I would have to fight everyone in this group anyway, and
            I was planning on tapping out of every match as it was. Max was a
            rock user. At first I thought this was just the common earth element
            but no. Max was a loud guy and would go on about how his element was
            different to the common earth element, all I knew really is that
            they acted similar to lightning attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You know I asked **** to put me against you first. Linhart said
            he'd pay big for the person who beat you badly." Max said leering at
            me as I stepped into the rectangle drawn on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily I knew just how to deal with his kind. "I forfeit this
            match. Congratulations on being the first to beat me, you can get
            paid now." I laughed and walked off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Fuck that." Max said and shot a rock formed from his mana at my
            back. The force was enough to knock me to the floor and almost vomit
            blood. **** and **** did not call the match, I was thinking half the
            class must of been in on this. They all kept quiet until now, Maxes
            big mouth helped me out. For once I was happy to find out loud mouth
            in a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grabbed a seed in my pocket and turned falling onto floor with
            maybe the worst acting you ever saw. Hoping my awkward movements
            looked more real because he had just hit me in the spine. I saw Max
            coming towards me his arm covered in rock. I threw a lighting seed
            at him which stuck to his robe parts piercing though and hooking
            into his skin. He just became more angry and ran at me ready to slam
            his rock covered arm in to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking now or never I used 'Seed-to-Soldier' and summoned a bacon
            bacon-leaf soldier on top of me to take the blow. His rock covered
            arm smashed into the soldier as he grew on top of me and cushioned
            the blow but it still hurt. There was a huge hole in the soldiers
            back, his plant like skin had caved in to show his bacon like flesh.
            I cast 'lighting growth' on him and he pushed down with his arms and
            shot up backwards into Max, pushing him back with his back as Max
            was pulling his arm back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to push off the floor and get to my knees so I could move
            when Max came back, Max was clearly not expecting the seed soldier
            and was momently confused until the soldier punched him in the face.
            The seed soldier was doing far better then I expected, Maxes rock
            arm was really strong but slow. As the two fought more I couldn't
            help notice the seed soldier really stuck to Max, keeping close to
            his chest not letting him use his long rock arm effectively. Max
            would swing the thing wildly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lightning seed gripping to Max was draining his health and
            recovering my mana however my health was not recovering. I had taken
            a lot of damage to my back, my muscles ached. The seed soldier had
            taken most of the blow for me last time but it still hurt. I
            scrambled to for some of the other seeds in my pocket, maybe I would
            need to use them again. This is exactly why I needed to level up
            more, find better gear and not take fights right now, I had no good
            spells for dealing damage right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Max had beaten the seed soldier to pieces, the plant matter was all
            over the ground, slowly turning in to a mulch. Putting stat points
            into magic was good so far but I was still floating stat and spell
            points and not using them was silly, I should of used them. I just
            need to last until Lubin notices what is going on. An idea sparked
            in my mind at that train of thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a furious Max stormed towards me gathering mana in his arm. You
            could see small rocks rolling up his arm to the tip. His arm had no
            been damaged in the fighting at all so he must be preparing for a
            ranged attack. While Max was collecting himself I reached into my
            inventory and pulled out my spear. The gasps and shocked reaction of
            the other students was exactly what I wanted. Lubin came rushing
            over the moment he saw he holding a weapon in my hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey! Stop! I know I did not say no gear other then your robes but
            every combat student should be aware the sparing rules by now! Even
            if you have been playing around on a farm. Get out." Lubin was
            furious, I just replied with a simple yes sir, put my spear away and
            walked out under his stare. Lubin's stare might of scared another
            student but while his stare was on me I felt safer.
          </p>
          <div className="BreakPoint" />
          {/* Give space for a scene change. */}
          <p>
            I was sitting outside when one of the medical students pulled me
            into the healing tents. My health was low and they had started using
            healing spells on me when Lubin had come into tent and found me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What the hell was that, I know you know better then that." Lubin
            said in a disappointed voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I had forfeit the fight and Max hit me in the back with an attack
            then continued to attack me when I was on the floor, the other
            students did not stop it. They are calling me cursed, saying Linhart
            had offered them money to beat me up." I replied, I knew he could do
            nothing with the information but I could at least tell the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I spoke with Max already, and the other students in your group.
            Your story and theirs do not line up. I suppose that is how these
            things always go." Lubin said sitting down on a chair looking at me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't know what to say. Clearly they are out to get me and I
            can't see a way for the academy to help." I shrugged.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well, you are right about one thing. The academy will not be
            helping you with this one. Things are changing and discipline is a
            must. You will be lucky if they don't make an example out of you. It
            might be better to use this incident to claim stress and move into
            farming...." Lubin said leaving his words hanging in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat there staring at him. I could believe what I was hearing. The
            academy would just give up, things are changing? All I did was show
            my weapon to defend myself from someone attacking me outside of a
            duel.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Do I have to make a decision now? All I did was threaten him in
            self defense." I said a little annoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No. Not now. But soon. Maybe by tomorrow it depends on Arrilian's
            feed back. I can't really let you back into the class. The non
            combat students are on normal schedules, maybe your farming friend
            could use some help today." He said. He stood up slowly and walked
            out of the tent, nodding as he left.
          </p>
          <p>Well this sucks.</p>
          <div className="BreakPoint" />
          <p>
            Without much choice left I walked down to the farm. It was still the
            morning and everyone was in either normal lessons or sparing with
            their classmates. The second years however would have the mornings
            to train or sleep in, so the streets were not totally empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The farm looked how it did in the afternoon. The students who took
            farming as their main study would be out in fields or research. The
            first years like Ralsan might have lectures but it was not everyday
            like the other students. I thought I would have to ask around and
            search for Ralsan but he was sat under a big tree eating various
            fruits, vegetables, meats and cheeses.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So this is what you do all morning." I commented seeing the spread
            out before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "This." Licking his lips. "Is the testing phase after months of
            carful crop breeding." He patted next to him. "Come and eat with me,
            honestly I am dying here." He said holding his belly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat down next to him and tried some of the food. It was really
            good, fresh food really is the best. "You don't seem surprised to
            see me." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am but, here you are so why complain." He said with a smile. He
            really was a nice guy.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I was kicked out of combat classes today for defending myself." I
            said while biting into what I thought was an apple but tasted more
            like a cinnamon raspberry pie. "This ones nice."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am sure there is more to that story. But as you know I have no
            interest in people's egos being hurt and waving sticks at each
            other. Better to just get along, work hard and eat good food." He
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You might be the only sane person in Alden." I replied with a
            smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ate for awhile and sat resting, stomachs full. "So now you have
            taken your bribe come help me out with some seeds." He said walking
            to the little research building from last time.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Nothings free." I said following. It is not like I had anything
            else to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the desk Ralsan used was covered in wooden boxes, seeds
            almost everywhere. Some where wrapped with string and labeled while
            others were just in huge piles. "And you never mix any of the seeds
            up?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Ah. Maybe don't touch anything." He said laughing.</p>
          <p>
            We sat there talking as Ralsan drew sketches of seeds, made notes
            and occasionally handing me a seed to germinate. His book was full
            of notes about each seed he could get his hands on. He told me he
            had been taking notes of success rates, quality, plants produced,
            look and use of all the seeds he could find along with more
            information but my brain was about ready to explode.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Say Ralsan, can I have some seeds?" I asked, maybe it was random
            but I had 4 spells depending on seeds and only 1 spell that did not
            require a them to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't see why not. Most seeds fail during germination process
            anyway and become waste. Look at this seed, fire lotus. Germination
            chance 4.42%. I never had one but a teacher brought one in for us to
            take notes on."
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought for awhile before asking. "Do you have any I can use for
            combat? Oh and one that turns into a pretty flower?" I said hoping
            he would not ask too much about the flowers.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Flowers?... You got a girlfriend? Say no more!" He quickly grabbed
            some seeds from a boxes behind him. "Tulips." He said putting the
            seeds in my hands. "They take months to germinate, years to turn
            into flowers but are very pretty. They are great for mixing with
            other elemental plants to make ... It doesn't matter you just want
            the flowers. I figure with your spells you could get them to bloom
            in moments and not years, whoever your girl is will be impressed!
            Trust me!" Ralsan said in excitement. Annoying he had hit the nail
            on the head.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Thank you. Fine you got me, it's a girl. Now how about combat
            seeds?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "A little bit harder, my main research is on food rather then pest
            control or defensive properties of nature." Ralsan said looking a
            little sorry. "You know if you are not looking for destructive
            power.. Try this." He said throwing a small grey seed to me. "Dwarf
            Ironwood tree. More of a bush really. Grows half the height of a man
            looks like a tree but the wood is as hard as iron."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Huh, like a shield? That could work. Thank you Ralsan, really." I
            said with earnest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to try it out right here, but as I held the seed in my
            hand. "Hey hey! Don't do it here. That tree is really hard to
            remove.. You already caused problems before growing things inside."
            He laughed as I put the seed into a little pouch.
          </p>
          <p>"Were did you get that seed pouch?" He asked seeing my actions.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah, there is like 100 of them on that desk over there... Should I
            put it back?" I said a little embarrassed.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha no it's fine they are for us anyway." He said and patted my
            shoulder and got back to work. Maybe I should of asked before using
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We kept at it for a few hours until lunch time. I always came down
            here at lunch time to talk to Ralsan and maybe get free food. So
            lunch time was the same as normal. "Hey you know, you really helped
            me this morning my work is weeks ahead now. Is there anything you
            need to do this afternoon?" Ralsan asked. This was a first for me,
            we had always been working, although I mostly did pest control and
            Ralsan did his research there was always something to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I mean, the only thing I have to do is level up you see I am
            actually a really low level... It has really held me back in combat
            classes and I picked up all those farming spells.. But it is nothing
            you can help with I just need to leave the academy to train but I
            cant right now because of various incidents.." I replied honestly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Huh. I guess I figured your level was higher then mine since you
            were doing combat.. What level are you?" Ralsan asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Ahem. Five..." I said embarrassed.</p>
          <p>"Five!? What the hell... You couldn't hurt a fly." He said.</p>
          <p>"Hey I have been killing the pests!" I protested.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah but... Ah we are going to fix that. I know some methods." He
            said with a wink... "Nothing illegal" I added.
          </p>
          <div className="BreakPoint" />
          <p>
            After lunch we walked following against the wall until we reached a
            small but very steep staircase. Looking up I could see the large
            bridge we had crossed to enter the academy at the start of it all.
            "How do the security let you build stairs negating the bridge?" I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Apparently they didn't at first, but the farmers just kept building
            it again. It takes ages to get to the south farms if you have to go
            back through the academy and it is not like anything but beasts
            attack this place. Even then it's been decades.." Ralsan replied
            walking down earth and wood stairs. I shrugged and followed, seems
            like the farmers had a point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The southern farms were vast. It made the northern farms look like a
            miniature farm in comparison. "This is where the majority of the
            teaching and farming takes place, our farm is just research really."
            Ralsan said seeing the shock on my face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Off to the west from there Ralsan took me to a grey 5 floor building
            with plants growing all over it, although the plants looked dead
            like this place had been abounded. There was only grass growing in
            the area around the building which looked odd because beyond the
            clear cut area was the jungle behind it. This was the edge of the
            farms like in the north but it seemed that no one came here.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't be fooled. It is not abandoned just badly damaged from
            experimentation. This is on of the research labs for defensive
            plants properties." With that he kicked open the wooden double doors
            to the building. The door creaked and bent and turned into shards of
            wood flying into the building and one of the doors fell off its
            hinges.
          </p>
          <p>"What the hell!?" I shouted after him.</p>
          <p>
            "We need to make it look like a beast broke in. I technically don't
            have the rights to use this place since you know, I don't work
            here." Ralsan said from inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            I rushed in after him and inside was dead plant matter all over the
            place, it smelt like compost. There were burn marks, blast marks
            across the floor, roof, walls and cracks everywhere. No way this
            place is safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ralsan was was in the corner pressing buttons on the wall. "Lucky us
            they did not disconnect the mana storage. No one else comes out here
            and it is a painful job I am told so they are quite lazy." With that
            he started moving leavers on the wall, a wooden trap door opened in
            the roof and a plant dropped down into the middle of the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Luminous plant. This one is just a child but it can still bite you
            even if it cannot swallow you yet. It is somewhere between level 1 ~
            9 after level 9 they grow into adults, most of it's stats will be in
            strength. Good luck." Ralsan said as the plant unfolded into a giant
            tentacle shape with yellow blobs along it's green shaft and a head
            that opened to show a red mouth inside. "A little warning would of
            been nice!" I shouted as the plant moved to attack me.
          </p>
          <div className="pop">
            Luminous plant
            <img className="popOut" src={Planty} alt="Plant" />
          </div>
          <p>
            I grabbed a seed from my pocket, it was one the bacon-leaf plants
            and grew it into a soldier. The seed soldier charged into the plant.
            I took some paces backwards as the soldier would cover me while I
            cast spells from the back. I gathered my mana into the palm of my
            hand and formed it into a lightning seed throwing it at the Luminous
            plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seed arced and landed on top of the plants stem, it had moved
            its head down to bite at my seed soldier and to my surprise ripped
            stright through it like a hot knife through butter. It spasmed it's
            head back and forth violently ripping the seed soldier to pieces in
            moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            "They are made of bacon. What were you expecting?" Ralsan said
            mockingly from behind the plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gritting my teeth I grabbed one of the new Dwarf Ironwood Tree seeds
            and germinated it. It might make a stronger seed solder but I was
            not going to take the risk right now and experiment. As the plant
            finished eating the seed solder I put the sapling in front of me and
            cast growth. The plant shot up to my waist, the branches were dark,
            ash-black with white and black spotted leaves. It really did look
            like a tiny tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the plant launched itself at me I ducked behind the tree and
            threw out another lightning seed. It was a little annoying but when
            I cast a new seed the old one disappeared, it was very strict about
            the limit on the description.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plant was not as fussed about this, my lightning seed cause
            damage over time and not upfront so the initial sting was rather
            small. Honestly I was a little out of ideas and pinned down.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey Otto, I don't mean to judge your style, but you know the
            Luminous plant is taller then the dwarf tree?" Ralsan shouted across
            the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked up, I saw the mouth of the Luminous plant open and start
            heading towards me. It had just reached over the top of the dwarf
            tree! I panicked and used 'lightning harvest' I had been practicing
            with it so much and the Luminous plant is a kind of plant, a moving
            man eating kind. I might of survived a bite, I had 5 vitality and
            the plant cant of been over level 9 itself. I would never get to
            find out if I would of survived though. The Luminous plant had just
            disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            I poked my head over the dwarf tree and sure enough on the ground
            was just some plant mulch. "So, what happened?" I asked Ralsan.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Eh? I thought you killed it. I didn't touch it." Ralsan said
            shaking his head confused.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who could blame him. No way right? I checked my inventory and sure
            enough inside was Luminous plant parts. When I harvest the normal
            bacon leaf plants I would get to keep the leaves and seeds. It
            seemed to just harvest what ever was useful. This time though I just
            got some leaves. "Hey Ralsan, does the Luminous plant rarely produce
            seeds? Or anything useful?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Er, normally yes it has a lot of useful parts but this was just a
            young plant, so no way it could of produced any seeds yet. Why did
            you ask that randomly?" He replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I accidentally cast harvest on it, the leaves are in my inventory.
            However this time I did not get any seeds. So I thought it was
            strange." I said back stating what had happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You harvested it? Is that not cheating? Can you just kill all plant
            monsters?! Check your spell!" Ralsan said with his mouth hanging
            open.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I did! It did not say anything about being used on monsters just
            that it harvests the target.... It can't be 100% of the time right?"
            I questioned Ralsan like he would know my own spells better then me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Armature hour over here. Do you get all of the information about a
            weapon when you scan it for the first time? Keep trying with your
            spell." He said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Huh? I thought you get all the information about spells when you
            unlock them?" I replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mmm yes and no. The academy is not really decided on it." Ralsan
            said shrugging his shoulders. I should really pay more attention in
            class, sounds like Ralsan has been. I used my inspect skill on my
            spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lightning harvest: Harvest the target. If the target is below 20% HP
            this attack does 200% more damage. If this target is a 'plant' type
            this attack does 500% more damage. If this attack kills the target
            you have a chance to harvest something.
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew what type of skill this was! An assassination type skill. I
            only knew this because back in the village Beke would always use
            this type of skill to kill monsters when we played. It was a common
            skill type for physical attackers to have access too, something
            about beheading a monster to finish it felt gratifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            More importantly though! I have an attacking skill. It really only
            hurts plants and low level ones unless I can get their HP below 20%.
            However with a 500% increase to my attack power, I should be able to
            kill even higher level plant monsters easily. What kind of cheat is
            this!?
          </p>
          <p>"Hey Ralsan. How many plant monsters are in here?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Loads. They are grown here for our experiments." He replied. "What
            about your skill did you find something out?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, let me show you. Keep sending plant monsters out, I am sure I
            will level up fast!" With that Ralsan smiled and sent more plant
            monsters against me. At first it was more young monsters, but after
            seeing my deal with them in one hit Ralsan decided to up the game a
            bit and sent out plant monsters that had recently become adults. I
            lost track of how many I killed but after a few hours Ralsan said we
            should leave. If we kept going on at this rate it would be too few
            left behind for the research team. I felt a little bad for them
            despite not knowing them, after all they were already going to have
            to take the blame for not locking up properly and disconnecting the
            power source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that I had leveled up. I did finally have a spell point to
            play with, I needed to be sure this time and get and offensive
            spell.{" "}
          </p>
          <div className="BreakPoint" />
          <p>
            I had to get back quickly. I had a date tonight so I saw Ralsan off
            at the farm and ran back to the Leikan area. I bathed quickly and
            headed over to the princesses manor. Tsuma worked there as a hand
            maid to the princess, but I had never met the princess. Not that a
            princess should meet someone like me.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was waiting for me in the manors garden. Wearing a long bright
            red skirt and wrapped white top in the Leikan style she looked
            beautiful. (Picture here? Think Kimono.) I walked over and she
            turned her head to look at me. "And here I was thinking you wouldn't
            show up."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Sorry I am late." I held out my hand with a germinated tulip seed
            and cast growth on it. I wish I could of done this with a whole
            bunch but I could not cast the spell repetitively without problems.
            The flower burst into life and shot up to be as long as my whole
            arm, and the bud blossomed into a bright violet coloured blue
            flower. "This is for you." I said handing the flower over.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh it is beautiful. Is it for me? No one has ever given me a flower
            before." She said slowly accepting it.
          </p>
          <p>"Eh? You never had flowers before?" I asked confused.</p>
          <p>
            "Well in Leika we use them for funerals, so I guess no one wants to
            be reminded of the dead." She said looking at the flower.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh. I am sorry I had no idea." I said a little awkwardly.</p>
          <p>
            "Oh no! I like it, I know Aldenese use them like this. I am really
            happy! I promise." She replied with a big smile.
