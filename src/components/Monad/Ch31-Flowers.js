          <p>The next morning I found a note had been passed under my door.</p>
          <p id="Fancy">Dear Otto,</p>{" "}
          <p id="Fancy">
            Studying all the time is not good for you, let's go have some fun
            tonight! I'll wait for you in the garden of the big house. They will
            let you in, everyone there knows you by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The note had no name but it was clear who it was. I guess it was
            true the people around here did recognize me now. It was not like
            some of the other students in the academy though. The people here
            were kind to me. Maybe it was because I was the only Alden living
            here I did stand out a little bit. I guess I should go to class,
            then tell Ralsan at the farm I will be going back early. Even if she
            said to meet tonight I want to get ready, and maybe because I wanted
            to skip any chance of drawing more attention to myself. Ralsan said
            he would keep quiet but things got out of control really fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I washed my face and put on my school robe. The house I had moved
            into was really big, even my room was much bigger. The whole place
            smelt of wood all the time though, which was nice but meant I could
            not really use magic inside the house. The only other person living
            in the house was a kind middle aged man who made me breakfast
            everyday. He woke up early every day because he worked at the
            princesses house like Tsuma did. I said he did not have to make me
            breakfast but he always did and left it behind for me with a note
            saying it was for me.
