          <p>The next morning I found a note had been passed under my door.</p>
          <p id="Fancy">Dear Otto,</p>{" "}
          <p id="Fancy">
            Studying all the time is not good for you, let's go have some fun
            tonight! I'll wait for you in the garden of the big house. They will
            let you in, everyone there knows you by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The note had no name but it was clear who it was. I guess it was
            true the people around here did recognize me now. It was not like
            some of the other students in the academy though. The people here
            were kind to me. Maybe it was because I was the only Alden living
            here I did stand out a little bit. I guess I should go to class,
            then tell Ralsan at the farm I will be going back early. Even if she
            said to meet tonight I want to get ready, and maybe because I wanted
            to skip any chance of drawing more attention to myself. Ralsan said
            he would keep quiet but things got out of control really fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I washed my face and put on my school robe. The house I had moved
            into was really big, even my room was much bigger. The whole place
            smelt of wood all the time though, which was nice but meant I could
            not really use magic inside the house. The only other person living
            in the house was a kind middle aged man who made me breakfast
            everyday. He woke up early every day because he worked at the
            princesses house like Tsuma did. I said he did not have to make me
            breakfast but he always did and left it behind for me with a note
            saying it was for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ate and walked outside, one of the men that lived in the small
            village style they set up waved to me and shouted "You must of come
            home late last night I did not see you in the baths." Ah that,
            Leikan people bathed every night in public baths. At first it was
            really weird to me that they bathed together and every single night,
            but honestly I got over it pretty quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, I went to do some training by the arena. I have not given up
            on combat classes just the farming thing was just a hobby like I
            said before." I smiled and waved back as I headed to class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class today had been built up over the past few days. Last week
            Lubin had announced that the class were going to have duels to give
            an individual ranking for the class. This meant nothing on official
            records but would effect how the class treated each other, and who
            they would party up with in the future. Right now, I was the bottom
            of everyone's lists. At first it was just because I did not really
            join in any of the spell casting sections just mana-control
            practice. Then word got out that even during the lightning class I
            was not casting any spells. However shortly after these rumors
            started up that I was cursed. That was when I started to move down
            in peoples minds past not wanting to partner with me to avoiding me
            entirely. Maybe I should of done something about it, but instead of
            extra practice and combat classes I had joined the farming club so I
            had been so busy and tired I never really noticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a good thing it was just individual combat this time around
            and did not reflect on our records so I could just tap out at the
            start.
          </p>
          <p>When I arrived I sat by the window as the other students came in. I was never really late for classes, I was just in the habit of waking up early now. If I didn't the nosy neighbors would let themselves in.</p>
          <p>No one sat next to me, but then again no one really paid attention to me. Maybe they were scared of me. If I was cursed they did not want to catch it. It's not like I was smelly or anything just the rumor that it was my fault people died in the tombs. I guess any student would be scared of someone like that when I think about it from their view.</p>
          <p>Lubin eventually arrived, a little late as always.</p>
          <p>"Okay we won't be in here long just a quick registration then down to the hall. It's good weather but another class is out there today." After that he shifted though the papers he had brought in he read though the list of class names again.</p>
          <p>The halls were used for clubs related to combat because the walls, floor and roof were built to be able to withstand spells. Well they were not built by Alden but who ever built the original buildings and have since then been used for that. </p>
