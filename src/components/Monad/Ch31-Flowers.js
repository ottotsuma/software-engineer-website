          <p>The next morning I found a note had been passed under my door.</p>
          <p id="Fancy">Dear Otto,</p>{" "}
          <p id="Fancy">
            Studying all the time is not good for you, let's go have some fun
            tonight! I'll wait for you in the garden of the big house. They will
            let you in, everyone there knows you by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The note had no name but it was clear who it was. I guess it was
            true the people around here did recognize me now. It was not like
            some of the other students in the academy though. The people here
            were kind to me. Maybe it was because I was the only Alden living
            here I did stand out a little bit. I guess I should go to class,
            then tell Ralsan at the farm I will be going back early. Even if she
            said to meet tonight I want to get ready, and maybe because I wanted
            to skip any chance of drawing more attention to myself. Ralsan said
            he would keep quiet but things got out of control really fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I washed my face and put on my school robe. The house I had moved
            into was really big, even my room was much bigger. The whole place
            smelt of wood all the time though, which was nice but meant I could
            not really use magic inside the house. The only other person living
            in the house was a kind middle aged man who made me breakfast
            everyday. He woke up early every day because he worked at the
            princesses house like Tsuma did. I said he did not have to make me
            breakfast but he always did and left it behind for me with a note
            saying it was for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ate and walked outside, one of the men that lived in the small
            village style they set up waved to me and shouted "You must of come
            home late last night I did not see you in the baths." Ah that,
            Leikan people bathed every night in public baths. At first it was
            really weird to me that they bathed together and every single night,
            but honestly I got over it pretty quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, I went to do some training by the arena. I have not given up
            on combat classes just the farming thing was just a hobby like I
            said before." I smiled and waved back as I headed to class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class today had been built up over the past few days. Last week
            Lubin had announced that the class were going to have duels to give
            an individual ranking for the class. This meant nothing on official
            records but would effect how the class treated each other, and who
            they would party up with in the future. Right now, I was the bottom
            of everyone's lists. At first it was just because I did not really
            join in any of the spell casting sections just mana-control
            practice. Then word got out that even during the lightning class I
            was not casting any spells. However shortly after these rumors
            started up that I was cursed. That was when I started to move down
            in peoples minds past not wanting to partner with me to avoiding me
            entirely. Maybe I should of done something about it, but instead of
            extra practice and combat classes I had joined the farming club so I
            had been so busy and tired I never really noticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a good thing it was just individual combat this time around
            and did not reflect on our records so I could just tap out at the
            start.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrived I sat by the window as the other students came in. I
            was never really late for classes, I was just in the habit of waking
            up early now. If I didn't the nosy neighbors would let themselves
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one sat next to me, but then again no one really paid attention
            to me. Maybe they were scared of me. If I was cursed they did not
            want to catch it. It's not like I was smelly or anything just the
            rumor that it was my fault people died in the tombs. I guess any
            student would be scared of someone like that when I think about it
            from their view.
          </p>
          <p>Lubin eventually arrived, a little late as always.</p>
          <p>
            "Okay we won't be in here long just a quick registration then down
            to the hall. It's good weather but another class is out there
            today." After that he shifted though the papers he had brought in he
            read though the list of class names again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The halls were used for clubs related to combat because the walls,
            floor and roof were built to be able to withstand spells. Well they
            were not built by Alden but who ever built the original buildings
            and have since then been used for that. The class went into the hall
            in cheers and egging each other on who was going to fight who and
            who was the strongest in our class. There was even one kid taking
            bets, the favorite being a girl called Sophie. She was from some
            minor house of something, honestly I had no interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Gather round, pick sticks from this pot and get into the group on
            that stick. Numbers one though six." Lubin shouted around the hall
            as he walked in. As always his instructions were short and to the
            point. You'd think he was busy but he left so much information out
            about the school I was starting to think he was just lazy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I picked the number three out on the end of my stick. The groups
            were made of 6 students each, our challenge was to fight matches
            against each other until each group had a champion then the
            champions would fight with all of the students watching. It felt
            like a pretty efficient way of doing it. Unlike the arena though
            there was no system to teleport us out when we became too damaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't kill each other, obviously. However you can injure each other
            and it is up to you to tap out in time. I will be moving around the
            room keeping an eye on everyone but I want the four of you not
            fighting to step in if one of your fellow students taps out. We are
            just practicing, none of this goes on any record and the purpose is
            just to learn from it not make enemies. Got it?" Lubin said from the
            middle of the hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class responded "Yes Sir." Like that the more domineering
            students told the others who they would fight or just challenged
            people in their group to fight them first. I was not picked to go
            first, Mila and Berta went first. Berta used water magic sending
            blobs of water at Mila followed up by thin fast shots of water. Mila
            at first did not really seem to be fighting back just trying to
            dodge the blows badly while muttering under her breath. Soon Berta
            broke out in sweat and started screaming holding her head and
            falling to her knees. I think Mila is a witch and cursed Berta.
            However Mila took one of the water shots in the stomach and also
            fell to her knees. She keeled over and started vomiting up blood.
          </p>
          {/*10,000 students per year. 36 students in a class, 278 classes? Well that is for the combat roles but not all students are combat. */}
          <p>
            "Take Mila to the medics and Berta to the priests. They are just
            outside the hall today in the courtyard, every combat class is doing
            this today." Lubin said to our group when Mila had fallen down. I
            was not sure who won but the other student marked down Berta as the
            winner. I guess it is a win like my first duel was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up was me and Max. I could not blame this on a fix because we
            drew straws I would have to fight everyone in this group anyway, and
            I was planning on tapping out of every match as it was. Max was a
            rock user. At first I thought this was just the common earth element
            but no. Max was a loud guy and would go on about how his element was
            different to the common earth element, all I knew really is that
            they acted similar to lightning attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You know I asked **** to put me against you first. Linhart said
            he'd pay big for the person who beat you badly." Max said leering at
            me as I stepped into the rectangle drawn on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily I knew just how to deal with his kind. "I forfeit this
            match. Congratulations on being the first to beat me, you can get
            paid now." I laughed and walked off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Fuck that." Max said and shot a rock formed from his mana at my
            back. The force was enough to knock me to the floor and almost vomit
            blood. **** and **** did not call the match, I was thinking half the
            class must of been in on this. They all kept quiet until now, Maxes
            big mouth helped me out. For once I was happy to find out loud mouth
            in a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grabbed a seed in my pocket and turned falling onto floor with
            maybe the worst acting you ever saw. Hoping my awkward movements
            looked more real because he had just hit me in the spine. I saw Max
            coming towards me his arm covered in rock. I threw a lighting seed
            at him which stuck to his robe parts piercing though and hooking
            into his skin. He just became more angry and ran at me ready to slam
            his rock covered arm in to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking now or never I used 'Seed-to-Soldier' and summoned a bacon
            bacon-leaf soldier on top of me to take the blow. His rock covered
            arm smashed into the soldier as he grew on top of me and cushioned
            the blow but it still hurt. There was a huge hole in the soldiers
            back, his plant like skin had caved in to show his bacon like flesh.
            I cast 'lighting growth' on him and he pushed down with his arms and
            shot up backwards into Max, pushing him back with his back as Max
            was pulling his arm back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to push off the floor and get to my knees so I could move
            when Max came back, Max was clearly not expecting the seed soldier
            and was momently confused until the soldier punched him in the face.
            The seed soldier was doing far better then I expected, Maxes rock
            arm was really strong but slow. As the two fought more I couldn't
            help notice the seed soldier really stuck to Max, keeping close to
            his chest not letting him use his long rock arm effectively. Max
            would swing the thing wildly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lightning seed gripping to Max was draining his health and
            recovering my mana however my health was not recovering. I had taken
            a lot of damage to my back, my muscles ached. The seed soldier had
            taken most of the blow for me lsat time but it still hurt. I
            scrambled to for some of the other seeds in my pocket, maybe I would
            need to use them again. This is exactly why I needed to level up
            more, find better gear and not take fights right now, I had no good
            spells for dealing damage right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Max had beaten the seed soldier to pieces, the plant matter was all
            over the ground, slowly turning in to a mulch. Putting stat points
            into vitality had saved me so far but I was still floating stat
            points and not using them was silly, I should of used them. I just
            need to last until Lubin notices what is going on. An idea sparked
            in my mind at that train of thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a furious Max stormed towards me gathering mana in his arm. You
            could see small rocks rolling up his arm to the tip. His arm had no
            been damaged in the fighting at all so he must be preparing for a
            ranged attack. While Max was collecting himself I reached into my
            inventory and pulled out my spear. The gasps and shocked reaction of
            the other students was exactly what I wanted. Lubin came rushing
            over the moment he saw he holding a weapon in my hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey! Stop! I know I did not say no gear other then your robes but
            every combat student should be aware the sparing rules by now! Even
            if you have been playing around on a farm. Get out." Lubin was
            furious, I just replied with a simple yes sir, put my spear away and
            walked out under his stare. Lubin's stare might of scared another
            student but while his stare was on me I felt safer.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          {/* Give space for a scene change. */}
          <p>
            I was sitting outside when one of the medical students pulled me
            into the healing tents. My health was low and they had started using
            healing spells on me when Lubin had come into tent and found me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What the hell was that, I know you know better then that." Lubin
            said in a disappointed voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I had forfeit the fight and Max hit me in the back with an attack
            then continued to attack me when I was on the floor, the other
            students did not stop it. They are calling me cursed, saying Linhart
            had offered them money to beat me up." I replied, I knew he could do
            nothing with the information but I could at least tell the truth.
          </p>
          <p>"I spoke with Max already, and the other students in your group. Your story and theirs do not line up. I suppose as always "</p>
