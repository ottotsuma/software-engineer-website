      <Hitori>
        On a long road, our large and exquisite black wagon thundered along in
        the heat alone. Inside, a group of people accompanying me were doing
        different things, completely ignoring the picturesque view just outside
        the window.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        Endless grass spread out to the horizon. Petite flowers of various
        colours broke up the endless green. Inside the wagon some teenagers were
        playing slaps, the noise they were making while laughing and having fun,
        pushed out any chance for me to catch up on lost sleep. I enjoyed the
        night shifts solitude, but this was the payment I had to make.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        At the back side of the wagon, some older men and women were sitting
        without making a noise. They all sat back, their eyes closed with
        passive faces. Sometimes it was possible to see a few of them sighing.
        The difference between the group who had experienced this before and the
        group of teenagers who were going there for the first time.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        But even with the teenagers being very noisy, the adults did not voice
        their complaints. They, like me, knew that on the way back, after
        everything they would go through in the dungeon, these excited teenagers
        would no longer differ from them.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        The first time I was the same, well maybe not as energetic as this lot.
        I had a drive to test my new powers, get rich quick but life wasn't like
        that, no. Life was too far from what I imagined.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        After seeing so many of my friends and companions die in front of me
        without being able to do anything, once they see, they too will finally
        understood how weak and insignificant they really are. This was the
        difficult life of a lower classes, students with Rank F and E like
        themselves. Different from the life of students Rank B, A, or S.
      </Hitori>
      <Hitori>
        Sitting just behind the group playing slaps were some teenage girls,
        since they were in the seats in front of me it was hard not to over hear
        their whispering.
      </Hitori>
      <p>"What is it, Hide?" The friend asked.</p>
      <p>
        "You weren't planning on going to talk to him, Utano?" Hide asked her in
        a light whisper.
      </p>
      <p>"Do you think he's cute too?" Utano replied quickly.</p>
      <p>
        After hearing what her friend said, Hide sighed and answered calmly. "I
        can see he's cute. However, since you are the oldest in your family,
        you've never heard of him. He's infamous. He's an F rank, but the power
        he has is completely useless in a dungeon".
      </p>
      <p>"Why? Is he that weak?" Utano asked back with a curious glance.</p>
      <p>
        "Weak would be an understatement; his abilities are useless. They say
        he's got a unique class, so he was moved into the special class, but
        after finding out how weak he was they moved him back into F rank. His
        looks started to get better bit by bit until he eventually looked that
        good, that's when they realised what kind of abilities he gained." Hide
        explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh... How is he even still alive? If he has no fighting abilities, why
        does he even come into dungeons? Since he entered so many years ago with
        the strength of an unskilled, it wouldn't make sense for him to leave
        there alive every time, since even some with good abilities can't..."
        Utano was shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nobody knows... Some say he only hides when he enters the dungeon,
        others say he keeps giving support from afar. Either way he's just going
        to be a burden on us." Hide said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utano's shoulders slumped down after hearing what Hide had said. I tried
        to not listen in, but they were in the next row, they could of moved.
        The teenagers began betting on who would kill more monsters. Some of the
        adults talked about how much money they would get from this dungeon, and
        some even ridiculed me out loud, saying how useless I was.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried my best not to pay attention to any of this. I opened my skills
        menu and focused on then new skill I had unlocked but had not used yet,
        a part of me was hoping I would never have to use it.
