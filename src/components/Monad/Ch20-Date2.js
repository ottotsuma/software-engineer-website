            Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a
            broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch
            zooming though the sky on your broomstick."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Aww, yeah something like that." She said softly and looked
            away a bit embarrassed by the compliments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my
            bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a
            magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really
            expensive, you should use it for yourself."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for
            a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I
            really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and
            holding onto the hat with two hands.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
          <p>
            The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would
            always fit perfectly.
