            "Fancy seeing you here." A female voice said from the side of me. I
            turned to see who it was, maybe they where not talking to me. Her
            face was still the image of an angel. Tsuma was standing next to the
            seat I was in watching the matches.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I saw you out there you know. Strength is an interesting choice. If
            you are worried about having muscles, working out still gives you
            muscles you know you don't have to put your points into strength."
            Tsuma giggled.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that, yeah. I am having doubts about my choices right now. I am
            sure things will work out, I just need to find a way to close the
            gap between me and the other mages and then I will be unstoppable!"
            I replied back happy with my answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That is a good plan! Maybe it will work. You know you cannot reset
            your stats, but I'll let you in on a secret. You can if you change
            your class or element, you can reset back to level one and do it all
            over again. It is mostly just nobles who can afford to do this but
            if you want I can share a class from Leika with you..." She said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, thank you but I have a plan. There is a mage in the history',
            an inquisitor. It's not the most direct way but if I keep going I
            can match his stat distribution, I already have the same element.
            What about you? Last time we spoke you said you where learning witch
            magic, tell me about it." I said.
          </p>
          {/* Gives Tsuma the witches hat */}
          <p>"I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a
            broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat." She told me.
          </p>
          <p>"Just like the fairy tales. You would make a beautiful witch
            zooming through the sky on your broomstick." I said.
          </p>
          <p>"I hope so.." She said softly and looked away a bit
            embarrassed by the compliments.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my
            bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a
            magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."
          </p>
          <p>"Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really
            expensive, you should use it for yourself." She replied trying to give it back.
          </p>
          <p>"I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for
            a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I
            really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift." I insisted.
          </p>
          <p>"Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and
            holding onto the hat with two hands.
          </p>
          <p>"Put it on let's see." I urged.</p>
          <p>
            The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would
            always fit perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I should repay you some way. Hope about I take you to the fair
            ground!?" She said excitedly.
          </p>
          <p>"What? There is a fair ground here!?" I asked confused.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, and this is the perfect time to go visit while everyone is
            watching the matches." She pulled me by the arm about of my seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Why is there even a fair ground here!?" I asked still confused.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't know, it's not part of my country." She said unperturbed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ran out of the area, past shops, restaurants and headed in the
            opposite direction of the cliff side and lakian camp. We where
            running to the nobles area, then took a sharp right and there it
            was. A small theme park, there was only 4 ~ 5 rides. Does a ferris
            wheel count as a ride?
          </p>
          <p>
            A log flume, a haunted house and a rollercoaster. Tsuma dragged me
            up the stairs to the fourth level wanting to get on the
            rollercoaster. Is this even safe? How does it work? I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            A happy looking mage sat in the front of a small pod, behind him
            where seats for two. "I'm Finn and I will be your driver today!" He
            said in a cheery voice. Seeing I looked a bit apprehensive he
            followed up with "It's perfectly safe. We are strapped into this
            metal pod and I use my magnetism magic to keep us on the tracks!
            There have been so few people today I am overflowing with mana!" He
            said very happy with himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reluctantly I got into the pod. Tsuma looked so happy and excited I
            calmed down a little. She must of done this before right? "How do we
            move forward?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finn turned around with a smile like a demon. His magic was used to
            give us a gentle push forward and then I noticed the giant drop
            down, it was not four floors high like we climbed but went into the
            ground where it was so dark I could not see the tracks or the
            bottom. "We use this fall to pick up speed!" Finn announced just
            before we dropped over the edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pod rocketed it's way down heading into the dark hole in the
            ground. It felt like the pod had lost contact with the tracks, and
            that was probably true, Finn would not keep us on the track because
            that would slow us down. As the pod started to fall into the hole I
            couldn't help but think Finn had lost control.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gripped the the pod hard as we fell into the dark hole, I felt
            Finn's magic pushing against the pod. The pod started to slowly turn
            to face forward then back up into the air and out of another hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            We shot up into the air and Tsuma screamed with joy. I was gripping
            the pod so hard I thought I might slam into the ground at any
            moment! We reached the peak and it felt time slowed. The pod started
            to fall back down to the ground. On the way back down Finn shouted
            "Wooo!" He really enjoyed his job.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the ride was done I felt like I had gone though a tough fight.
            I turned and saw Tsuma was elated. "Which one do you want to try
            next?" She asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, I've never actually been on a ferris wheel. Is that one fun?" I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Hmm I guess, do you want to try?" She asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah. I'll pay for this one, since it was my idea." I replied as we
            made our way over to the ferris wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            We sat in the ferris wheel talking about Alden. Tsuma had great
            interest in Alden, so far as learning the language fluently, and
            trying to find out about the culture. It seemed like she had mostly
            just learned about the rich in Alden and their culture. To me it
            felt like there was two different cultures in Alden and the more we
            spoke the more I became convinced the culture and experiences she
            described where very different from what I had experienced so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma described in great detail the hunts that Aldens go on every
            month, accompanied by great beasts from the forests to hunt down
            even greater prey. Meals where accompanied with honey mead, our
            homes where great estates painted in various murals and finally
            everyone loved their local lords and dukes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not that I refuted these things, just that it was not my
            experience. I had never met anyone that had anything nice to say
            about their local lord or duke, but I had not yet had much dealings
            with them. Just the compliments I heard from the other villagers. It
            is true the dukes are known to have tamed or captured fierce monsters
            from the forests of Alden, without them our population would of been
            worn down in wars over the years. The idea we all had one and went
            hunting regularly though could not be true.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Say what is Leika like? How is it different?" I asked, wondering if
            there would truly be any difference or it was that rich where very
            different form the normal people.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hmm, I guess everyone who visits says it is clean, people are
            polite and that is is safe. Everyone told me I have to stay with the
            other Leikans while I am in Alden, that Alden is not as safe. It's
            really annoying because I cannot even leave the academy while I am
            here!" She complained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah. I have been out a few times into the wild around the academy.
            I'd love to say you are not missing out, but truly I enjoy exploring
            out there more then being here. I am planning to go again if you
            want to come with us?" I asked a little hopeful that would help her.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I know you have, everyone is talking about where most of the
            professors went recently. I don't know if you are lucky or very
            skilled." She laughed. "I would love to come out, but they won't let
            me, I wouldn't even make it near the gates before they dragged me
            back in afraid." She said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well for a start Alden uses tamed monsters from the forests which
            are really unique and cool! They have witches and curse magic while
            in Leika we use the 鬼 (Oni), kind of demon like creatures we summon
            instead and they can be really creepy." She seemed really excited to
            see Aldens monsters, I would have to show her someday! "Oh we also
            make the melon pop that is famous! I hear Alden buys lots of it."
            She said more as a question it seemed.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahem, yeah we do. I really love it, my grandad use to drink it all
            the time I was told. He died the same month I was born.. A long time
            ago, I never met him or anything." I said realising I brought the
            mood down.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh, how did he die? Monsters?" She asked.</p>
          <p>
            "The sea people invasion over 10 years ago, he was a scout and was
            tracking them. I don't really know anything more, I was 0 years old
            after all. Did they invade Leika?" I asked kind of curious.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, their first major landing was in Huonhoa, to be honest from
            what I learned it did not seem like they scouted much. Just landed
            the first place they arrived. They where not friendly and attacked
            on sight, they did not act like they expected to be pushed back at
            all." She said with a thinking face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon we where at the top of the wheel. I looked around and you could
            see almost all of the academy and a little bit over the walls since
            the fair was on the edge of the academy. "At least you get to see
            outside a little bit." I offered.
          </p>
          <p>"Yeah, that is true." She said.</p>
          <p>
            "When we are strong enough, let's just go traveling the world. They
            cannot stop you if you are stronger than them." I smiled.
          </p>
          <p>"I'd like that." She replied.</p>
          <p>
            Soon we were back on the ground after having spoke more about Alden
            and Leika. I wanted to keep talking to her, I guess the fair ground
            kind of reached it's climax already since it was so small. There is
            the log flume but who wants to get wet on a cold day!
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey do you want to go out for drinks with me? Like now?" I asked
            hoping she would say yes.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh, I want to. I don't drink though." She said softly.</p>
          <p>"Eh? you don't drink? Not even water?" I asked confused.</p>
          <p>"... I mean I don't drink alcohol." She said.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah right! Sorry, that was silly of me, I mean we can just go to a
            cafe again." I suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully she blamed my reaction on her Aldenese. I felt bad, she
            was fluent but I gave the wrong response making her feel worse about
            her language ability. We went over to the cafes again, this time we
            picked a normal cafe and was able to get hot coca. I always wanted
            to try it, it was as good as it sounded. Warm and sweet, I should go
            to the kingdom one day, they have great taste. Although why a
            country as hot as the kingdom needed hot drinks? Who cares. Tastes
            good.
          </p>
          <p>
            We talked for the rest of the afternoon about the pyramid, what
            happened. I found myself telling her everything, even the parts I
            kept from the academy. Even the parts I kept from Tisiel. Something
            just clicked with Tsuma.
