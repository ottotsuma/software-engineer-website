            "Fancy seeing you here." A female voice said from the side of me. I
            turned to see who it was, maybe they where not talking to me. Her
            face was still the image of an angel. Tsuma was standing next to the
            seat I was in watching the matches.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I saw you out there you know. Strength is an interesting choice. If
            you are worried about having muscles, working out still gives you
            muscles you know you don't have to put your points into strength."
            She giggled.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that, yeah. I am having doubts about my choices right now. I am
            sure things will work out, I just need to find a way to close the
            gap between me and the other mages and then I will be unstoppable!"
            I replied back happy with my answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That is a good plan! Maybe it will work. You know you cannot reset
            your stats, but I'll let you in on a secret. You can if you change
            your class or element, you can reset back to level one and do it all
            over again. It is mostly just nobles who can afford to do this but
            if you want I can share a class from Leika with you..." She said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, thank you but I have a plan. There is a mage in the history',
            an inquisitor. It's not the most direct way but if I keep going I
            can match his stat distribution, I already have the same element.
            What about you? Last time we spoke you said you where learning witch
            magic, tell me about it." I said.
          </p>
          {/* Gives Tsuma the witches hat */}
          <p>
            Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a
            broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch
            zooming though the sky on your broomstick."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "I hope so.." She said softly and looked away a bit
            embarrassed by the compliments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my
            bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a
            magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really
            expensive, you should use it for yourself."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for
            a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I
            really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and
            holding onto the hat with two hands.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
          <p>
            The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would
            always fit perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I should repay you some way. Hope about I take you to the fair
            ground!?" She said excitedly.
          </p>
          <p>"What? There is a fair ground here!?" I asked confused.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, and this is the perfect time to go visit while everyone is
            watching the matches." She pulled me by the arm about of my seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Why is there even a fair ground here!?" I asked still confused.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't know, it's not part of my country." She said unperturbed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ran out of the area, past shops, restaurants and headed in the
            opposite direction of the cliffside and lakian camp. We where
            running to the nobles area, then took a sharp right and there it
            was. A small theme park, there was only 4 ~ 5 rides. Does a ferris
            wheel count as a ride?
          </p>
          <p>
            A log flume, a haunted house and a rollercoaster. Tsuma dragged me
            up the stairs to the fourth level wanting to get on the
            rollercoaster. Is this even safe? How does it work? I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            A happy looking mage sat in the front of a small pod, behind him
            where seats for two. "I'm Finn and I will be your driver today!" He
            said in a cheery voice. Seeing I looked a bit apprehensive he
            followed up with "It's perfectly safe. We are strapped into this
            metal pod and I use my magnetism magic to keep us on the tracks!
            There have been so few people today I am overflowing with mana!" He
            said very happy with himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reluctantly I got into the pod. Tsuma looked so happy and excited I
            calmed down a little. She must of done this before right? "How do we
            move forward?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finn turned around with a smile like a demon. His magic was used to
            give us a gentle push forward and then I noticed the giant drop
            down, it was not four floors high like we climbed but went into the
            ground where it was so dark I could not see the tracks or the
            bottom. "We use this fall to pick up speed!" Finn announced just
            before we dropped over the edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pod rocketed it's way down heading into the dark hole in the
            ground. It felt like the pod had lost contact with the tracks, and
            that was probably true, Finn would not keep us on the track because
            that would slow us down. As the pod started to fall into the hole I
            couldn't help but think Finn had lost control.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gripped the the pod hard as we fell into the dark hole, I felt
            Finn's magic pushing against the pod. The pod started to slowly turn
            to face forward then back up into the air and out of another hole.
