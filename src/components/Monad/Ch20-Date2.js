            "Fancy seeing you here." A female voice said from the side of me. I
            turned to see who it was, maybe they where not talking to me. Her
            face was still the image of an angel. Tsuma was standing next to the
            seat I was in watching the matches.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I saw you out there you know. Strength is an interesting choice. If
            you are worried about having muscles, working out still gives you
            muscles you know you don't have to put your points into strength."
            She giggled.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that, yeah. I am having doubts about my choices right now. I am
            sure things will work out, I just need to find a way to close the
            gap between me and the other mages and then I will be unstoppable!"
            I replied back happy with my answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That is a good plan! Maybe it will work. You know you cannot reset
            your stats, but I'll let you in on a secret. You can if you change
            your class or element, you can reset back to level one and do it all
            over again. It is mostly just nobles who can afford to do this but
            if you want I can share a class from Leika with you..." She said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, thank you but I have a plan. There is a mage in the history',
            an inquisitor. It's not the most direct way but if I keep going I
            can match his stat distribution, I already have the same element.
            What about you? Last time we spoke you said you where learning witch
            magic, tell me about it." I said.
          </p>
          {/* Gives Tsuma the witches hat */}
          <p>
            Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a
            broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch
            zooming though the sky on your broomstick."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "I hope so.." She said softly and looked away a bit
            embarrassed by the compliments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my
            bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a
            magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really
            expensive, you should use it for yourself."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for
            a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I
            really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and
            holding onto the hat with two hands.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
          <p>
            The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would
            always fit perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I should repay you some way. Hope about I take you to the fair
            ground!?" She said excitedly.
          </p>
          <p>"What? There is a fair ground here!?" I asked confused.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, and this is the perfect time to go visit while everyone is
            watching the matches." She pulled me by the arm about of my seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Why is there even a fair ground here!?" I asked still confused.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't know, it's not part of my country." She said unperturbed.
