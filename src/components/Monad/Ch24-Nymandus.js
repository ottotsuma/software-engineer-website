          <p>
            After seeing Ditwin and Gelfrat being over run by tooth fairies of
            all things. These creatures are not taught about until the 2nd year,
            so how Tisiel and Reingard knew to run before we did, I do not know.
            Maybe they where looking for any excuse to run away from Ditwin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say once I realised what they where and what was going
            on I also ran out of the tunnels. By the time I reached the first
            fork Tisiel and Reingard had long gone. My original mission given to
            me by my tutor was to slay a level 30+ undead beast, that is the
            only reason we had permission to leave as it was. With that still in
            my mind I ran down the tunnel with the strongest rejection of my
            light element. So far this place has had only low level undead like
            most tombs, I was surprised to find the magic skull say there would
            be high level undead down here, I might be able to complete my quest
            and get back sooner then I had expected. Maybe that is why I rushed
            down here without proper rest. I feel that now, I am tired.
          </p>

          <p>
            After awhile of running and now walking. My legs hurt. There seemed
            to be no end to this tunnel and the rejection of my light element
            seemed to only be getting stronger. If I can complete my mission and
            get back to the academy before the others I can report this place to
            my tutor before the rest of the academy finds out, along with the
            information about the magic skull. Who knows he might recommend me
            to be an apprentice of the champion of light. Then even if I am
            unlucky I will still become one of the strongest undead hunters in
            Alden.

          <h4>Ditwin</h4>
          <p>
            I had just thrown a mana-rock into the pond when a bunch of freak
            looking flies came out and started to bite onto me. Easily enough to
            fix, I wrapped my whole body rock-mana and they can bite into that
            all they want. I turned to see Gelfrat trying to help by shooting
            them off me with his water only to start screaming when they bit
            into him.
          </p>

          <p>
            He kept screaming, I turned to get help from Nymandus but he had
            already run off like a coward, his true colors showed when it
            mattered. I knew we should of stayed with Linhart, we should get
            back to him. I shot mana-rocks at all the fucking flies I could see
            trying to get to Gelfrat. He was covered in bites from head to toe,
            chunks of flesh missing from various places, with a really obvious
            part missing from his cheek.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Run you moron, they are going to rip you apart." I shouted through
            my rock form. I grabbed hold of his arm and dragged him away as he
            shot rocks and water behind us. The little flies followed us out
            into the tunnels.
          </p>

          <p>
            All we could do was keep running, trying to remember which way we
            came from. Luckily after running down a few of the tunnels they
            stopped and started to move back, some stayed around unwilling to
            come any further forward. It must of been the light stone at the
            other end, they must be pushed away by the light magic. Just have to
            get back to where that first year is and get out of here and find
            Linhart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the flies had left us alone, we walked deeper into the tunnel
            area. "You'll be fine, we are going back the throne room, we can use
            healing potions there." I told Gelfrat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gelfrat did not reply. Maybe the hole in his cheek did not help but
            he seemed to be a lot quieter then normal. I put him down on the
            side of the tunnel to rest. Maybe we did not have time to get back
            to the throne room, seems further away then I remembered. I got out
            one of the health potions from my inventory.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You should be use to it by now, but fair warning this will sting."
            I poured the liquid inside onto his wounds and tried to get him to
            drink the last of it. I could hear him try to complain about the
            pain again but his throat must of been screamed sore. The only
            noises that escaped his mouth where poor whimpers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I sat down next to him for awhile, trying to keep him company. I
            thought about carrying him the rest of the way but I had to keep
            guard over him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually Gelfrat stood up, he started to walk off down the tunnel
            holding his stomach and face. I stood up and walked after him as he
            turned to see if I was coming. Before I could even process what was
            happening in my mind let alone shout out a dark flash came out of
            the darkness, a zombies hand and smashed into the side of Gelfrat's
            head. He slammed into the wall on the side, blood spraying along the
            tunnel as his body slumped down against the wall without a head.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wanted to scream, undo what happened, wake up. None of those
            things happened through, as if by automatic response I shot mana rock
            towards the zombie and covered myself in rocks. Before the
            transformation finished something stung my neck, and I crushed it
            with the rocks. A small bug.
          </p>

          <p>
            The zombie was surrounded by bugs, they where all over the place,
            but I was safe under the rocks, they seemed to have no defense at
            all and just squashed from any light touch.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wanted to get Gelfrat back, I know he's dead but maybe I can do
            something? Anything? I shot rocks at the zombie, and the insects
            landed on me but they could do nothing as I swatted at them. The
            zombie did not move back at all when the first rock slammed into
            him, in fact it just rolled off him like I had shot the rock at the
            wall.
          </p>

          <p>I am sorry Gelfrat. I ran.</p>

          {/* Ditwin burns to death with the feeling of cold fleeing after gelfrat death, gelfrat is smashed into a wall by an undead, tisiel runs off with Reingard and the skull goes to the bridge where the skull sees no gap but the others do because he's dead. After otto goes into the lightning tunnel Linhart goes out of the exit after watching ditwin die.*/}
          {/* <h4>Gelfrat - Swap with Ditwin?</h4> */}

          <h4>Linhart</h4>
          <p>
            Huh, I never killed anyone before. Even after seeing that kid get
            blasted by the lightning the force of my fireball sent him to the
            other end of the tunnel, although he must be a pile of ash by now.
            He deserved it for tricking me on the bridge back there. If the
            others found out what happened I would of become a joke, now without
            him here there is no one to refute me. Weird through, the elders
            always told me the first time you kill someone it's very common to
            feel sick. I guess common means it's not certain.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walked over the stone he was sat on earlier. If the others where
            underneath it would save me the time to just wait here if what he
            said was true. As I was walking there, my body felt cold, shivering
            like a ghost had passed through me, my stomach roiled and turned
            inside. Then I vomited. Bent over holding my stomach as its contents
            emptied onto the stone floor. Guess I had a common reaction after
            all.
          </p>

          <p>
            over a quarter of an hour later I was sat on the throne. My insides
            felt hollow, since I had mostly meal pills and not real food there
            was not much to bring up. Still, it was a horrible feeling. Don't
            even regret my actions, just kind of wish he fought back and I
            killed him in combat. Bit of sad first kill.
          </p>

          <p>
            A weird sound came out from behind me, I turned and saw nothing. It
            sounded like Ditwin to me, although muffled. I went over to the
            stone behind the throne and tried to push it a side but it would not
            move even a little. Strength was a attribute for people who wanted to die
            up close anyway, I would just use my mana to move it. I put the
            cloth bag of black powder inside a gap in the stone and set it on
            fire and jumped back. I had got it from a professor while studying
            the uses of fire element under him, he was assured with this powder
            he could find a way to make the fire element the dominant element in
            battle but as of now .... BANG ... It could just make small
            explosions.
          </p>

          <p>
            To my surprise the rock barely moved! The thing was heavier then I
            thought, must be some kind of magic interaction I am not aware of. I
            peered down the small gap created when the stone moved during the
            explosion, even more embarrassing the rock was still solid nothing
            had broken off. That professor had a long way to go. I could see
            through into the darkness and waited for my eyes to adjust.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ditwin? Is that you? Why are you alone and covered in rocks?" I
            asked into the darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It burns! let me out. Let me out. I am so cold. It's coming. Let me
            out." He pleaded, I had never seen him in such a state before,
            Ditwin was not the kind of person to plead with anyone about
            anything. Hot and cold? Had he gone mad. "I can't move the rock
            easily, hold on I need to find a metal bar or something." I told
            him.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Don't leave me to die. I .... AHRHAGHAHHGHGH" I saw his body get
            pulled back a little into the darkness and chunks of rocks, blood
            and flesh spread all over the place. "Crap." I started to shove the
            rock shut with my feet kicking it as hard as I could and blasting it
            with fireballs after. I don't know if it shut fully, because I ran
            away. I was going back to the academy to let them know what
            happened!
          </p>

          <h4>Tisiel (& Reingard)</h4>
          <p>
            It felt like we had followed Vortigern's directions for half the
            night because my legs where killing me. The pain was just shooting
            up and down my legs from the ache. I wanted to at least spend some
            time with Reingard alone but Vortigern just had to ruin that, at
            least if we are going somewhere that somewhere we would still be
            alone, kind of. Maybe with a group of undead around us, but still.
          </p>

          <p>
            Waking from my walking day dream, I noticed we had reached a large
            set of black doors, Or at least they looked black with the little
            light we had. They where at least 20 meters high with large handles
            hanging from the middle like this was built for a giant. "Vortigern,
            do you know where we are?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Sorry, I was a little stunned myself. These doors are from my time,
            when I was alive I mean. The style and size are reflective of only
            our kind back when we ruled." He replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What, your skull is the same size as ours, yet your bodies where
            tall enough to need door like this?" I asked, sure he was mistaken.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Long story, but yes we were much bigger then you, and my skull was
            shrunk during the process of refining a magical item strong enough
            to last the process. Everything was bigger back then and the air was
            different then it was now. Anyway the important part here is I can
            open the doors." After which he spoke some strange words and the
            doors started to open by themselves. "In we go. I am sure of where
            we are now."
          </p>

          <p>
            Fine keep your riddles, you'll have to tell me later I thought
            stepping inside past the doors, as we walked through the doors kept
            opening slowly. inside was giant reception desk inside a stone wall,
            like a take away shop in the academy. The desk was entirely empty,
            would of been weirder if it was not honestly.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we went inside more, we walked around the reception desk and
            heard a huge BANG. The doors had finished opening. Inside was rows
            and rows of swords, armour, shields and other items all lined up on
            display on ranks and manakins. "Vortigern, is this, the treasure
            room?" I asked gently.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It was a shop or armory, the treasure room would be in the back.
            It's still the best place to go other then the library but I can
            tell you where we are now. Or rather what we are inside of." He
            said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'd like to know." I replied moving between the items. They had
            tags next to them, not in the language of the symbols I translated
            but Vortigern's language. Since we had spent more time on the
            pyramid language I was unable to read these. "Also what do the tags
            say?" I added.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hmm? Oh they are item descriptions, your ability to identify items
            is uncommon today, but back in my time it was one in a million,
            these tags helped us to know what the item did without extensive
            testing every time. I'll translate them later. We are right now
            inside one of my kins bodies, although blown up in size, the
            opposite of how I shrunk, his body was used as a tomb to house
            whoever was important enough to require a tomb of this grander where
            his followers would take up residence in the tomb to protect his
            resting place. This is actually my first time inside one of these
            kinds of tombs but I read about them a lot. The tunnels back there
            should of been made out of the passages within his brain." He
            explained.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Number one, eww. Number two, the pyramid also had his followers
            buried with him, was that your influence?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Number one, this was not a normal burial but set aside for only the
            greatest of us so show some respect. Number two, no, many cultures
            have similar traditions but the pyramid was statues, where the ashes
            of the flowers where added later they where not buried with him." He
            answered.
          </p>

          <p>
            I turned to see Reingard and ask him to help me collect the
            treasures around here, but I saw he was half way through grabbing the
            helmet off one of the giant statues... I burst out laughing. "Leave
            the giant items, and just take the smaller stuff, once we grabbed as
            much of that as we can we are going to the treasure room and
            library. If we have room left we can come back for these things.
            Magic items only shrink down to fit the users if you can equip them
            so they won't shrink and take up too much room." I explained to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Your parents are archeologists right? Not grave robbers?" He
            questioned back with a small smile.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could only give him a smile back. There was a thin line between
            the two since items found in tombs of other civilizations and
            especially old eras could turn out to be great treasures of today!
            Or in some cases worthless like the time my mother found a spy glass
            that lets you look at objects so close that it no longer resembles
            the object you are looking at...
          </p>

          <p>
            "Vortigern, do you think any of these pieces we have missed are
            worth taking with us?" I asked quickly before we moved on.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Everything in this room would of been a great treasure back then.
            The problems that the enchantments might of decayed, there could be
            a species restriction or in some cases like the ring of storage in your
            hand, a very rare and useful enchantment in my time, I remember we
            the immortals where obsessed with these rings, but erm well. Now you
            have your inventory the demand for this item has made it very cheap
            today. It acts as a second inventory, a place to store things. Since
            you can store 1kg per level even a low level has sizeable storage
            space as it is today." He rambled on some more but gave no
            indication that any of the items in here really stood out as worth
            anything crazy today.
          </p>

          <p>
            While he was talking about all the different items we passed along I
            made my way to the treasure vault. It was another large door,
            although this one was one quarte the size of the last one, maybe
            this was a single person door for these giants. At some point
            Vortigern always left more questions then answers running around my
            head and I feel like it would take a life time or two to find out
            everything he knew. I'll get rich first and then write books on what
            he knows.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Vortigern, hate to interrupt, but could you open the door?" I
            asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh. Well you see this tomb was built by the death faction and I was
            part of the third fact of balance so I don't have the means to open
            this particular vault." He replied mater of fatly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could feel my eye brow twitch. "Then why did you bring us to this
            door?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well I just thought you would of wanted to know with your interest
            in history and all." He replied a little confused.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could not fault him for that. It was true. But what about the
            money...
          </p>

          <p>
            "You immortals sure where cleaver, but like the others you also died
            out. There must be a way around these mechanisms, a fault in your
            technology?" A voice came from the back of the weapons room.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah the old band is back together." Vortigern said without me even
            turning him around. I guess it is true his eye socks mean nothing in
            terms of sight.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Otto!" Reingard said walking over to give him a big hug. It looked
            like those two have been getting closer without me. "How did you get
            here?" Reingard asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            He pointed to what looked like the the same doors we came through
            except they where completely white and at the opposite end. "Linhart
            pushed me through the lightning tunnel this is where it came out." He
            replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            "He WHAT!?" I was stunned, Linhart was not dead? He tried to kill
            Otto? And it didn't kill him!?
          </p>

          <p>
            Hugging Reingard with one arm Otto carried on his questioning, "So
            your technology had flaws right?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, erm, fine, yes. It was not perfect, you see we were always
            following and chasing after the true meaning of the Dao and to that
            end we developed most of our technology based on that left behind by
            the people in the era of the Dao but never really catching up in all
            areas. That means that despite our best effects there are flaws. Now
            the Dao era..." Vortigern tried to continue but Otto interrupt
            again.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What flaws? Since you are here Nymandus & Dipshit & Rat-face could
            come at any moment, and there is back from the dead Linhart to deal
            with. So please." Otto asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Okay, okay. There are several methods to breaking most immortal
            arrays but you have to know they are very rare. Our main nemesis
            throughout the whole era was heavenly lightning which would
            occasionally just drop down with no reason and strike us. There were
            the immortal fires of hell, the void and..." Before Vortigern could
            go on listing off impossible ingredients that have long since
            disappeared from this earth he was interrupted again.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Lightning, got it." Otto walked up to the door and pressed his hand
            against it.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Not any lightning, heavenly lightning. It's not the same thing at
            ...." And mid speech he became speechless, and I became slack jawed
            as the door just swung open easily with Otto's hand.
          </p>

          <p>
            He turned to look at us three standing there confused and slack
            jawed. "My teacher specializes in types of lightning, heavily seemed
            to be his favorite. While it is lost from this earth, the Gods
            possess it and can grant it to mortals. When they feel like it."
            Otto said and shrugged.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What kind of God has to spare power to hand out heavenly lightning
            to open doors!?" Vortigern said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "One with no other followers." Otto retorted as he stepped inside
            the treasure room.
          </p>

          <p>"Fine, keep your secrets." Vortigern said after him.</p>

          <p>
            Once I stepped inside I found myself surrounded by gems from the
            roof to the floor. Reds, greens, blues, purples, pinks, oranges, the
            list would be never ending. "Spirit jades, spirit stones." Vortigern
            said. "Among many others. They where used by immortals to become
            more powerful quickly. Maybe of no use to you."
          </p>

          <p>
            I grabbed one from near by and tried to identify it. *Ding* *Jade*
            Not sure if it was because it was just ordinary jade or because the
            skill failed because my level in it was so low. I put it back a
            little disappointed. "Jade is a precious material, but its not
            magical. What do you wanna do Reingard?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "One or two might not take up much room, but there is thousands at
            least. It might be better to take one of the magical weapons back
            and hope the enchantment is useful or there is no species
            restrictions." He replied earnestly.
          </p>

          <p>"Urgh, this tomb was suppose to make us rich." I complained.</p>

          <p>
            "There is more armour back here." Otto shouted from up ahead. I got a
            little excited and bound down past the jewels and saw Otto stood
            before a set of black and red leather armour, boots and arm guards.
            To his left where 4 other sets of armors and mounted behind them
            higher up was one last set. Each set had stone tablet tags along
            side them so we asked Vortigern to translate them all for us.
          </p>

          {/* magicarcher.jpg */}

          <p>
            "Starting from the right, with the black and red set. It say's here
            it is infused with the element of fire in each of the pieces, a
            different skill is attached would be the best way to translate this
            I think. There is no attribute buff on any piece, and let me just add
            that magic items with skills are rare today but in the time off
            immortals is basically unheard of outside of royal circles. There is
            a brief description of each skill but if the armour even contains
            useable fire elements after all this time let alone is a skill I am
            not sure." Vortigern explained as Otto stared on with a blank face.
            Knowing him he just liked the look of the armour once he finds out it
            cannot help him he will lose interest if another piece suits him
            better. Vortigern went on to explain the other three pieces in a
            similar manner. They where earth, water, metal and wood.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for the final set of armour up on high, it was pure black in color
            and was said to contain the death element. The black from each armour
            set was to show their allegiance to the king of death, who would
            wear the final set. "I would hazard a guess that if we were to
            travel to the school of light they would as well have similar sets
            in white." Vortigern added. "This being just a theory, because these
            elements made up the most important elements to us at the time,
            think of these sets more as honorary ranks. It is likely they date
            back to the age of the DAO rather then my own age. I don't know if I
            mentioned before I came from a third faction outside of these two so
            my knowledge was limited at the time and not much greater now. My
            faction had similar sets of mixed white and black in color as a show
            of balance."
          </p>

          <p>
            After his explanation I tried to identify each set. All I could see
            was question marks which was both good news and bad. Good news is
            they still contained at the very least trace amounts of mana. Bad
            news was, how much, did they still have skills inside? Was this just
            junk? Would they be restricted by species?
          </p>

          <p>
            "Tisiel's thoughts are almost audible" Otto side to Reingard to my
            side as I was working. I puffed up my face and stared at them both
            and responded with, "If you know what I am thinking how about
            helping?"
          </p>

          <p>"I want the red one, Reingard?"</p>
          <p>
            "The silver one, metal remember? Or did you forget again?" Reingard
            replied with a cocky smile. "Looks like lightning was not one of the
            chosen."
          </p>
          <p>"Chosen? Lightning was our nemesis!" Vortigern interjected.</p>

          <p>
            "I can pick the all black death one right?" I asked kind of hoping
            it was on the table also.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It still only counts as one." Otto replied with a shrug and looked
            at Reingard.
          </p>

          <p>"That leaves earth, water and wood." Reingard said.</p>
          <p>"Any preference?" I asked to them both.</p>
          <p>
            "Earth, counters Otto's lightning." Reingard said laughing to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>"Water, I don't want the green one." I said smiling at Otto.</p>
          <p>
            Otto just shrugged. "I'll only end up selling which ever to you two
            later." With that he stored it away. Then started to strip off!
          </p>

          <p>"What are you doing!?"</p>
          <p>
            "Putting it on, I wanna try it out. Don't you?" Otto replied like I
            was the crazy one!
          </p>
          <p>
            He had a point through, I wanted to see if the skills still worked.
            "Okay but you two get out of here, and take Vortigern with you." I
            threw him to Reingard.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't understand why I have to leave." Reingard complained on his
            way out. "I don't understand why you are both so moody, I am not
            even the same species as you two." Vortigern added.
          </p>

          <p>
            With them gone I tried on the black outfit. Black leather boots,
            leather top and leather arm guards that went over my hands as gloves
            and over my shoulders, on top of them was metal guard plate layers
            falling down my arm like scales. My black skirt with dark gold
            patterned hem and black long socks fitted nicely with the outfit. I
            equipped my small bags over the top and I was done.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could feel the mana moving from me and throughout the armour, there
            was only 3 pieces in total and it felt like part of it was missing
            although I could not explain it. I could only put it down to there
            was no head gear or weapon to match. If it was an outfit for the
            ruler of death maybe there should of been a crown?
          </p>

          <p>
            I tried to move my mana into the arms to see if any skills would
            activate, but no matter what I tried it seemed like either I did not
            have enough mana or maybe the pieces where defective after all it
            has been ... 7 maybe 8 eras since it was made. Most of my other
            equipment was accessories through so it did not hurt my combat
            capability to keep it on.
          </p>

          <p>I went outside to see the others.</p>

          <p>
            Otto had black leather boots with metal in places dyed with red as a
            second color, his black baggy trousers under with a black leather
            armour onto, with red trim and in the middle a red 8 pointed shape
            that was not quite a star. In the middle was a fire pattern in gold.
            On his arms where wrapped looking arm guards with red woven
            throughout.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard was starting to look more like a prince, with his outfit
            being black leather throughout but on top and sometimes peeking
            through patches in the leather was sparking silver plates. It was not
            real silver but it looked like it was but something much stronger.
            He held in his left hand a shield made of his metal mana. Curiously
            we all had three parts each with no head or weapon.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hey Tisiel, could you look at some of my old items? I think they
            got damaged in the lightning. I want to check if its worth keeping
            them." Otto asked handing over a pair of black boots.
          </p>

          <p>
            I scanned them and the first thing I saw was the items new name.
            "Ruined boots." I wouldn't have to look any further to see that they
            where now useless. He the got out a pair of black burnt gloves which
            I knew to be brown in the past and a deformed metal pole. I just
            shook my head at him and told him it was not worth assessing.
          </p>

          <p>"So did either of you get the skills to work at all?" I asked.</p>

          <p>
            Reingard moved his shield to the side and showed me silver metal
            crawling all over his outfit until he was covered in silver all
            below his neck. "I don't know how strong it is but Otto couldn't
            dent it with his ...Is that your warhammer?" Reingard asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah. It was. I am a little worn out after being electrocuted a
            thousand times so maybe that was not the best test, but yeah, seems
            like an armour skill." Otto said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah, looks really useful! I couldn't get mine to work at all." I
            replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, I don't know how the other two work, so maybe they are like
            mine and need to keep trying them out in different situations?"
            Reingard smiled trying to cheer me up.
          </p>

          <p>"Did you get yours to work?" I asked to Otto.</p>

          <p>
            Otto stared at me, not saying anything. I was confused then saw
            smoke coming from under his boots and he stepped away and the floor
            was on fire. "Not sure how useful setting myself a little bit on
            fire under my shoes will be in combat but it's fun." He said as if
            he was not bothered by what just happened.
          </p>
          {/* gloves, adds fire to a weapon. boots, change the surface to fire. chest, reflect damage as fire when hit in melee*/}

          <p>
            I was a little frustrated that they both at least gone some level of
            the skills to work while I could not, but like Reingard it was very
            likely they where situational skills and I should be happy to even
            have on piece of equipment with a skill on let alone a set. If they
            have a set bonus effect for wearing more pieces then it would be
            priceless.
          </p>

          <p>
            After cheering myself up a bit I asked Vortigern if he would know
            how to take us to the library or anywhere else useful. Even with
            what we have already it might be a good idea to leave and inform the
            academy of the location of the tomb and sell what we have. Though my
            parents of course there is no way I am letting the academy get their
            hands on these. They would not pay us at all.
          </p>

          <p>We set off back into the tunnels with Vortigern leading us.</p>
