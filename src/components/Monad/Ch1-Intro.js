          <p>
            In the Principality of Huonhia at the northern most point, I stood
            waiting to receive orders from the Huonhian general. I was part of a
            mercenary company brought up for this battle, we where a mixed band.
            I am a magic swords man wielding both magic and a short sword, the
            max next to me was a berserker wearing the head of a wampus cat and
            holding a giant two handed club. It was normal for us to work in
            small groups with whoever but a Huonhia general was wealthy enough
            to buy up our whole company and a few others for the season.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had clashed with these opponents a few times this season and they
            where presenting their last stand to hold us back as they scrambled
            for their boats to get back to the sea. I have seen some unique
            fighting styles but theirs was a new one to me, at age 30 though I
            am sure there are more to come. We already beat them four times.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put a stop to my random thoughts the general with a wind wizard
            next to him projected his voice for all of us to hear. It came loud
            and strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Victory is near at hand! If all do their duty, it will be OUR
            victory!"
          </p>
          <p>"YEAAAHHH!"</p>
          <p>
            "Many times I have faced this enemy and many times I have beaten
            them."
          </p>
          <p>"YEAHHHHHHH!"</p>
          <p>
            "Let us offer prayers to the gods for victory. And then let us arm
            ourselves to the teeth, just in case the gods aren't listening."
          </p>
          <p>"Ahaha!"</p>
          <p>
            "The enemy war god must have a sense of humour, I mean look at
            them."
          </p>
          <p>"Ahahaha!"</p>
          <p>"By tomorrow our arms will ache from over-use!"</p>
          <p>"Woo!!"</p>
          <p>
            "The enemy may have the Fish on their side, but we have excellent
            shoes! And those shoes will stamp out their fish!"
          </p>
          <p>I guess that is why he has the title 'The mad'.</p>
          <p>"Charge!"</p>
          <p>
            The Huonhians moved in first, in lines with long spears pointed out
            over their shields. They formed walls of spears and white armor. To
            the flanks where the skirmishers, those who threw projectiles or
            magic into the enemies to tie them down. We where behind them. Once
            the skirmishers pulled back we moved in to tie up the disorganized
            enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the skirmishers started to pull back we ran in. I cast
            'Ice spear' into their ranks. I wrapped my sword with ice magic as
            we got close. The berserker from before shouted louder then a war
            drum next to me and jumped into their ranks swinging his club around
            at whoever was near by. With their ranks fully broken up I was able
            to fight small duels which was more my style.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used my sword to move my opponents to one side and launched a ball
            of hardened ice into his chest.He pushed though the pain so I let my
            ice magic spray out from me causing him to slow and be cut by small
            flakes of ice. I moved in and stabbed him just below the waist. He
            moved back holding his stomach and cursed in a language I don't
            know. "썅놈" I moved back as he was dieing and gathered magic into
            my hand. He reached down and pulled up a wand? He pointed it right
            at my head and the sound it gave off blew my ear drums out, there
            was a large flash of light, then nothing.

          {/* The Grand Duchy of Alden is home to 3.2 million people */}
          <p>
            Jun 12 21-12, In the north east of the continent of Charia, in the
            Grand Duchy of Alden was a town called Steinauhau.

          <p>
            "Congratulations!" A unified cheer rang out around the town hall,
            looking down into my cup I lamented, the reflection looking back at
            me was far older then it use to be. Stiff and past the age where I
            should be drinking luminescent green drinks. I had always liked
            melon pop ever since I first tired it over 70 years ago now. Soon
            the reflection in my cup smiled back.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You look happier then you have in years." My thoughts interrupted I
            turned to see my old friend Edmure.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I was just thinking about how new life replaces the old" I
            continues to smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a frown at first and then smile Edmure retorted "You thinking
            your grandson is here to replace you?, there is still life left in
            the both of us yet".
          </p>
          <p>
            The small gathering carries on into the night. June 12th a night the
            people of Alden celebrate the new life brought into this world over
            the past year, a small tradition as not all make it past infancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edmure whispered into my ear, there have been sightings of the sea
            people off the coast. They had been pushed back into the sea at the
            last battle of Huonhia so they must either be heading home or
            looking for a new place to land. I nodded and left the town hall and
            went to the walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            I left the town, and went though the forests. I went to the area
            where the sea people where last seen and going though the forest I
            saw their boats off in the distance. I had to check if any of them
            had come ashore before reporting back. I passed though the forest
            easily with my legs and body strengthened by mana. The trees that
            would scratch at my skin bent and broke as I passed by quickly
            leaving behind no marks on my skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found them. Moving though the forest slowly. They did not see me,
            I know this place like the back of my hand. I pulled out my dairy
            and started to take notes on their location, how many, kind of
            weapons etc. I wrote down everything I could remember, right up
            until I heard a click then my vision went black.
          </p>
          <h3>Michkel</h3>
          {/* <!-- starting with the kids meeting as friends, introduce the town, some news the people, small parts of the world, culture--> */}
          <p>
            It had been 10 years since I had found the blood soaked diary on
            David's body. He was my wife's dad. Edmure, his best friend, had
            later moved to Swexausern, about 25km north-west. I was told he died
            peacefully two years ago. Today was June 12th and the town was
            getting ready for the same festival again. I guess that's why I was
            thinking of him again today.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey Karla." I waved across the town square towards her holding
            hands with 3 children. Two older girls and a boy, all the children
            had red hair like their mother. As the two groups got closer I
            nudged Sarah and pointed to our son's smiling face. He only smiled
            like this when Effi, Karla's daughter was around.
          </p>
          <p>"Good to see you are all well" Sarah said. </p>
          <p>"You too, Where is Robert?" I asked. </p>
          <p>
            "He's going to meet us later on, went to the hall to get the news
            and left me alone with these loverly lot." Karla replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our group now larger, made our way towards the wood near by. We met
            with other adults of the town and their children. The children ran
            off into the forest to play as the adults made way for a fire, today
            is a festive day June 12th.
          </p>
          <p>
            While setting up in the morning Robert joined us and shared the news
            of the of the on going northern border problems. People living there
            have been unhappy with the Republic's increased taxes and taking
            their children to fight a war so far away from home. The villages
            still had to fend off monsters of their own. The republic had a
            massive Avalanche in Neuenese and a Fault in Moborodian, the earth
            there had opened up and monsters in the depths had spread out. The
            rebels fed up with their treatment had forces between
            100,000~300,000. Since most where not soldiers beforehand the
            success of the rebels was blamed on Aldens supplying the rebels.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We have been supplying them haven't we?" I asked. "If not, we
            should. They are Alden also."
          </p>
          <p>
            "We have." Robert replied. "Too obviously it seems if even the town
            inspector knows we have." He joked.
          </p>
          <p>"Aha, well is there any news not from the Republic?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Elves have cat fever. Gianlongian in Huonhia has a drought, their
            second biggest port city included. Desonean in the Kingdom has
            flooded, the main river though the kingdom that is. To top it all
            off a Malgian Crusade has been called in the Kingdom, I can only
            hope those crazy zealots die in the desert." Robert said.
          </p>
          <p>"What a year." I commented. "What's cat fever anyway?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            Robert shrugged. "A fever cats get I guess, there was not much news
            about it since it's from so far away. Anyway come inspect some of
            the woodcutting axes, we need to know their durability so no one
            gets hurt."
          </p>
          <p>
            With that I went to do my job in the town, inspecting low level
            items for their durability. Item inspectors ranged in jobs because
            of their skills and talents. Your talent in inspecting items might
            show you a different result. Some people see short descriptions
            about the items, others just a generic letter rank from F - A. I had
            the rarest trait, to see the items in numbers. Each had their
            advantages, numbers where more precise. The problem was my inspect
            skill was quite low, so while I could see information accurately, it
            was low level information such as durability and the
            items name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every night I teach my son Otto more about the skill, he also has
            the numeric trait. Inspect is one of the few skills in the world
            that do not require skill points to learn, which is nice. However
            that means it requires talent, practice and luck. I was lucky enough
            to have mediocre talent. It's a safe well paying job, I hope Otto
            can learn it so he can have a safe life.

            their parents, they arrive at a circular clear area within the small
            wooded area they often play. Eugen 13 years of age, larger, and
            taller then the others of the group, but without a temper or
            ambition he plays with children younger then him rather then the
            older children of the town. Beke, 12 a slow child, but easily
            angered. Ilse 12, the oldest child of Sarah and Robert. Effi 10 the
            younger sister of Ilse. Otto 10 the oldest son of Michkel and Karla,
            with two younger brothers, and a sister on the way. Nils 10 the 8th
            child of the town leader, although only 5 remain. Jakob 9, A small

          {/* <!-- What about adding the children arguing instead of just saying they did? --> */}

            farmers"

            "Of course I know! We all went to lessons, they move the mana inside
            them to where it is needed to become faster or stronger" Otto
            replies happy with himself
          </p>
          <p>
            "You cant be a fighter, you don't have a sword, bow or anything at
            all! you have to be a mage, unless you want to be a rouge.." Beke
            snickers.
          </p>
          <p> Otto picks up a stick and swings it about like a sword</p>
          <p>"Ahahaha" Beke burst into laughter</p>
          <p>"It's a wand. I was just testing it."</p>
          <p>
            "You two stop arguing and get into position the monster is here!"
            Ilse points to a tree with a monster draw onto it's side..
          </p>
          <p>
            That is how the team ended up with 4 melee fighters, 2 ranged
            fighters and 1 mage
          </p>
          <p>
            "Charge!" <br /> "Heavy blow!" <br /> "Battle shout!" <br />
            "Provoke"
          </p>
          <p>
            The sounds of the fight ring out though the small clearing. "Hig-h
            Impact!!", "Fire Ball!". "fire ball? That's not a junior skill thats
            intermediate. We all agreed to start at junior level." Berk grows
            towards the smaller Otto. "I thought we must of leveled up by now!"
            retorts Otto. "Why would we level up it's not even dead yet!" Berk
            shouts back. "come on now, we can't get distracted in a fight! Otto
            must of just got tired of being the mage every time" Ilse steps in
            to redirect Berks attention. "He's the mage because he cannot afford
            a real weapon, that is not even a wand it's just a stick" Beke spits
            out. Otto looks down at the stick in his hand, true enough it was no
            real wand. "that's what wands are, just sticks, now kill that
            monster!" Isle points towards the tree and Beke runs up and slams
            his shield into the tree and stabs it with his sword point before
            triumphantly shouting that he had slain the monster.

            The group where playing deep inside the forest when one of them
            discovered lurking near by. A leaf green figure, with a large yellow
            eye, webbed hands and feet with black sharp nails attached, a small
            belly and a slight hunchback. Its mouth shaped like bird beak but

            charge. Unaware of the dangers of reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ilse shouts commands at the others to form-up and attack, ordering
            Otto to cast a protection spell on the Eugen, Effi to stand and
            protect her as she gives commands. Jakob and Nils take ready their
            bows while Beke & Eugen ran forth and provoke the creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first the young Kappa is surprised and taken back by the sudden
            attacks and loud shouting, the children are spurred on by their
            apparent advantage. Beke slams his shield into the creature and
            stabs at its ribs with his wooden sword shouting "shield bash" with
            great joy. Eugen follows up by stabbing into the creature with his
            spear, the tip is dull but with enough force to pierce though the
            creatures skin, a long high screech sounds out in the clearing,
            confident Eugen tries to thrust further in but is unable. A toy
            arrow lands at Jakob's feet, Nils off into the distance. A child's
            cry fills the air, Eugen balled over on the ground holding his face
            as blood drips from it, in the struggle to pull his spear back the
            young kappa had slashed across his face in its panic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ilse dashes froward to help, as Beke in his panic and anger curses
            Otto, "You where told to cast protection why didn't you cast
            protection!" Otto knowing this is no longer part of any game
            desperately wishes he could of done anything at all to help, drops
            his wand. The young kappa no sooner had slashed the boys face freed
            himself of the spear jumps on his back and stabs his webbed claws
            into his his neck. Blood squeezes out of the holes and around his
            sharp claws, Ilse runs up to the pair and tries to pull the creature
            off. Beke standing before his friend screaming in pain, starts
            hitting the creature with his sword and stabbing at his eyes, soon
            the creature lets out a screech as he jumps off Eugen, who is now
            silent on the ground in a pool of his own blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effi who was suppose to be protecting her older sister had been
            stood still in the shock of it all, suddenly sprung to life and
            jumped into the frey, the 3 children, Ilse, Beke & Effi beat on the
            monster with their swords defending with shields. The monster now
            hidden from view of Otto muttering magic spells he heard of from
            stories and Jakob collecting a few rocks from the ground, while Nils
            throws them at the monster where he can.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the short frenzy the creature knocks Effi aside, and makes a
            break for it running towards the tree line, the children give chase,
            Jakob bending down to pick a rock is slammed into by a fleeing
            monster who rips at Jakob's face and sides pulling out chunks of
            flesh and blood from the screaming child. The others more panicked
            scream and run towards the monster and Jakob Beke first, larger and
            stronger then the others who pushes the monster off Jakob only to
            receive quick swipes towards his shield, Ilse dives in and plunges
            her sword into the creatures left eye, it oozes out black liquid as
            the creature lets out a loud scream and plunges his claws into
            Ilse's stomach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effi arriving later then her stronger faster comrades pushes her
            shield between Ilse and the creature who with his weight alone
            pushes them to the ground, Effi holds the shield between them trying
            to protect her older sister as the creature strikes down a blinding
            flash of light appears near the creatures one good eye and blinds
            it. "Heavy strike" Beke shouts as he slams his sword over the
            creatures head, as the creature spins and swipes its claws randomly
            Effi shouts "Provoke" and feels the creature attention directly on
            her, despite it being unable to see. It charges, as the creature
            arrives onto Effi's shield again, Ilse plunges her little toy sword
            into the creature's wound and its heart stops from the impact, the
            creature falls to the ground breathing heavily as Beke smashes his
            sword over its head again. It die's from blood loss shortly after.
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole encounter took just a few moments, even though to the
            group it felt a long time. Two of their friends lay dead in their
            own blood, Nils kneels by Jakob's body shivering unable to bring
            himself to move or speak. Beke shouts out for all to hear, blaming
            all of the others, until his eyes land on Eugen only then does he
            break, seeing his friends mangled and shredded face. Effi holds her
            older sister in her arms, repeating over and over that mother will
            be here soon, it will be okay. Ilse dies looking back at Effi unable
            to speak, lungs full of blood.
          </p>
          <p>"Level up!" the words cover Otto's vision.</p>
          <h3>The body</h3>
          <p>
            After hearting the children scream like they where really in trouble
            this time myself, Robert and a few others ran over to check on them.
            Jakob, Eugen & Ilse lay dead. I grabbed Otto and shock him demanding
            to know what happened. Robert ran over to Ilse and Effi and burst
            into tears, he screamed so loud everyone else in the town came
            rushing over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hours later I was stood next to robert over the dead body of the
            monster. "You know what kind of creature this is?" I asked. "Yeah, a
            Kappa, a young one at that, less then 2 years old." Robert replied.
            I looked towards Robert and he continued. "Not native to here of
            course, I've never seen one this far south, or this far from a
            river, they rarely leave the waters only to snatch prey or children
            who wonder off alone. But never this far and never before they reach
            adulthood."
          </p>
          <p>
            We stood watching the body burn. "Scouting turned up nothing, maybe
            it really did get driven south by the events in the north, there
            were no traces of other kappas in the area. That being said I have
            had reports of increasing monster attacks from Swexausern." Robert
            said.

            Sitting alone in my room later that night I could not help but
            reflect back on what was told to me earlier. The numbers displayed
            in front of me right now where my stats and my level, 1.
          </p>

            I was told not to spend any of the points, that I was going to be
            sent to the town hall tomorrow to be tested for my aptitude and when
            I was 14 I would go to the magic academy in Banderedam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all the stats where 0 however, this could not be good.
            Thinking at first there was a mistake I asked my parents but I soon
            learned that these numbers are a display of how much the mana can
            affect me and my spells, them being 0 just means that my mana flow
            to these areas is poor. The mana would not contribute toward
            anything I tried to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            All children growing up are told stories of heros and villains,
            magic, monsters, and great warriors. But nothing was ever said about
            how to unlock their class, skills, or stats. Almost like everyone
            who had unlocked them was sworn to silence, today I found out that
            was true. For their own protection as the only way to unlock stats
            was to slay a monster in battle without the help of anyone with
            stats, knowing this some children might carelessly try and fight a
            monster before they where 14. Naturally not everyone kept the secret
            and most children had killed a monster before they where 14 just
            usually just one their parent had picked out for them, something
            less dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before bed I was told the story of the witch of Alden. This was a
            story I had been told over and over. The founder of our country.
          </p>
          <p id="Fancy">
            The witch of Alden was born when men with wings ruled the continent.
            They came from the heart of Pocotcotco, a country far to the west.
            They came with the powers of the monsters and enslaved and ruled
            over the people of east. The witch found the academy near Banderedam
            where she built up her power and with that power pushed out the
            westerns and founded the city of Alden. Seeing this weakness in
            their rulers the other people of the east threw off their western
            rulers and built kingdoms and principality's for themselves. The
            witch not wanting to rule alone made her commanders dukes. So Alden
            is a Grand Duchy.
          </p>
          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          <p>
            Beke outside the town hall, looking around he could see some of the
            children he use to play with, the older children of the area. They
            pay little or no attention to Beke as he comes into the hall they
            instead are deep into their studies or practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            He makes his way past the children on the right practicing with
            swords, spears & shields. To the left children practice copying the
            movements of different animals, boars, snakes, dogs, cats even rats.
            A look of rejection comes across Beke's face to these children doing
            odd movements. He arrives are the large wooden doors to the hall,
            *describe the hall* He makes his way inside, seeing children sitting
            around reading, silently, taking notes, the atmosphere in here
            around these children made Beke feel unconformable, not his kind of
            thing. Soon he finds himself stood in front of an elderly man with
            grey hair, a long nose, long wrinkly fingers, the old man was
            wearing a thick woolen cloak. Even Beke knew better then to
            interrupt this particular man.
          </p>
          <p>After a few moments the mans voice booms out "Late".</p>
          <p>
            "S-sorry Mr. David I had to clean as punishment for.." his eyes
            drift off and memories of the incident start to come back, but
            before he could clearly remember..
          </p>
          <p>
            "I don't want your excuses, do your cleaning then run here tomorrow.
            Now let's see what your aptitude is, place your hand on here,
            quickly now."
          </p>
          <p>
            "aptitude?" before he can talk any more his hand is dragged over a
            small rock, it looks like the ocean it's self is stored inside the
            rock, the reflection never sitting still. Soon after his hand is
            placed on the rock it turns to a light sea green. "Well, was not
            expecting that, maybe I judged you too quickly." Beke looks up
            confused at his statement "Sorry?"
          </p>
          <p>"Expected you to be a Fighter, seems you are a Rouge"</p>
          <p>
            "No, no, that can't be I must be a fighter, my brothers are
            fighters, my farther my mother, my whole family are all fighters!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "That is not how this works, Rouges are outside today, on your right
            as you leave, can't miss them." David goes back to his paper work.
            Beke looks on for a moment before realising he has been dismissed
            there is no arguing, he puts on foot in front of the other walking
            back to the door he came in from thinking over and over, no, it has
            to be wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beke makes his way over to the Rogue group, the children around him
            are still moving in weird ways. The adult teaching them walks over
            to Beke. "So you are a Rogue then? Best to see what kind."
          </p>
          <p>"What kind?" Beke looks around. "Like what animal I am?"</p>
          <p>
            "Ahahaha, no, no. Don't know much about Rogues do you? Alright let's
            start from the beginning"
          </p>
          {/* <!-- Shit about rouges --> */}
          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>
            While the other children trained and practiced Beke was taken to one
            side and asked what he knew.
          </p>
          <p>"So Beke why did you want to be a Fighter?"</p>
          <p>
            "My whole family are Fighters, I would of been a really good
            fighter, I am stronger and larger then the others my age."
          </p>
          <p>
            hmm I do see your point, but let me clear some things up. Firstly
            Rogues are not Fighters who mimic animal moves, anyone can do that.
            If someone want to fight while acting like a monkey or a snake that
            is up to them but that is not exactly what is going on here. You see
            Fighters move mana throughout their bodies to increase their speed,
            strength or even defend from attacks this much you might already
            know from your parents. A Rogue however uses their mana to reproduce
            how monsters fight. It's not so much about the movements but how
            they use their mana, let me show you.
          </p>
          <p>
            No sooner had he stopped talking a large black tail, as long as his
            own body had appeared behind him and slammed into the ground, the
            ground fell and gave way to its quick and powerful strike. "Scorpion
            tail, that is my spirit."
          </p>
          <p>
            "So I can grow extra body parts, parts of monsters to help me
            fight!?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha well yes" he gestures towards his own tail. "However also no.
            It is not about having extra body parts, although you can, I've even
            seen a man who replaced his eyes with that of a bird of prey, made
            him an amazing archer. The point is being a Rouge is about taking
            what advantages a monster has and making them or own. From level 1
            though to 10 we mimic the monster we want to steal from, learn how
            they fight so that we can kill them, eat their heart and take their
            spirit for our own."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Eat their heart? gain their spirit? Are you saying if I eat the
            heart of a dragon I can grow wings and breathe fire?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe, I never known anyone who bested a dragon in single combat
            and then ate the dragons heart, so what abilities and skills can be
            learned from a dragon I do not know. But I do know you should not
            pick a dragon as your first target."
          </p>
          <p>"I don't think a dog or a cat would suit me."</p>
          <p>
            "You are right about that, like you said you are big and strong,
            since you are later then your class mates to level you will not
            reach level 10 as quickly as them, perhaps you should aim a little
            higher, something that suits you."
          </p>
          <p>
            Beke for once in his life, stops, takes pause and thinks about what
            would suit him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You don't have to decide right this second you know, there are
            records of other Rouges you could see what abilities they got before
            you decide. For today since you came with your sword and shield, let
            us train basic fighting."
          </p>
          <p>With a nod Beke agrees and joins the group.</p>
          <h4>Effi POV</h4>
          <p>
            So Strength increase the physical damage you do, and magic how much
            magical damage you do. Vitality how long you can survive, this
            includes resistance to poisons. Willpower, and endurance are fairy
            self explanatory. Dexterity affects your speed, reaction time, how
            precise you are, those sort of things. Sense is not just detecting
            traps but sensing someones mood and many other things and finally
            your charisma or charm i've heard it called both but it affects how
            amiable people are towards you.
          </p>
          <h4>Beke POV</h4>
          {/* <!-- Lunch and discussion of the others  --> */}
          <p>
            After training with the others in the Rogue group, Beke started to
            like it, although his level was lower he was popular with the others
            who wanted to train against a new opponent and made a few new
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beke places his lunch try down and looks around at his group of
            Rogues, the Fighters sitting on other tables. "So where did Nils end
            up, as a mage?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh, no he is practicing to be an artist, I hear he's going to go to
            the Capital to train"
          </p>

          <h4>Skill tree lesson - Otto</h4>
          <p>
            After being directed away by an old man behind a desk I was facing a
            room of other children like me sitting on the floor off to the side
            of the main entrance. There was about 14 like me in total and a tall
            skinny man at the front, his boney hand gestured for me to sit down
            anywhere. As soon as I had he carried on speaking as if I had always
            been here.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If you remember from earlier Luis told us that when you unlock your
            first level, you will have access to your skill trees. These trees
            are where you can spend your skill points to acquire new abilities
            or just improve your current abilities."
          </p>
          <p>
            "You all have 2 skill trees right now. Your class, for you all
            sitting here today that is Mage. If you put points into this skill
            tree you will increase the amount of mana you have, learn magic
            spells and other wondrous things. Your second tree is your race, for
            everyone here today that is clearly Human. For other races such as
            elves from the Mifuegan League and naga from the kingdom, their race
            tree will not be human but of their own race."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Today we will be looking at the Human skill tree. This skill tree
            is often overlooked by not only combat focused people but also other
            races. While other races might get direct combat related skills and
            buffs the human skill tree is mostly focused around the charisma
            stat. This is the most overlooked stat in my opinion but you can
            make up your own mind."
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the day we made notes and learned about the
            various skills and advantages and of course the disadvantages the
            human skill tree. The overall gist being that the human skill tree
            made humans appear more trustworthy, liked and various boots while
            in a party. This made humans particularly in large numbers, and
            political environments.
