            The dinner party had been a blast, the food was nice, I got to dance
            with Reingard. He looked so handsome even if he wore the same formal
            academy clothes as most of the other boys.
          </Tisiel>
          <Tisiel>
            The grey shoulderless hour-glass satin dress, glided down my body.
            It was nice to soon be back in my comfortable fluffy pajamas. The
            Academy had provided all students with clothes sleep, formal
            occasions and classes. However nothing beats your own pajamas.
          </Tisiel>
          <Tisiel>
            My room was still a mess. An organized mess, were things were
            carefully placed were they were suppose to be. Even if I often
            forgot were they were. It was a collection of things I had found
            digging around tombs with my parents, snooping around the academy
            and poking about the older lesser or unused parts of the academy.
            Honestly I might never of come if that was not the case. The academy
            was almost like it was housed in it's own miniature world, with even
            more to find inside of it. Most people think the academy is just a
            far away land connected though the portals, but that's hardly a fun
            way to think of things.
          </Tisiel>
          <p>
            Looking though the bones, trinkets and nick-nacks. I tried to find
            my latest note book I still had to find out more about my latest
            editions to my collection. Settling down into an old wooden chair by
            my study table, I always wrap my hands around the curved handle, old
            habits.
          </p>

          <Vortigern>
            "Well it's not quite as orderly as my study but I approve." A
            strange deep voice said from some location.
          </Vortigern>

          <p>
            I froze and slowly looking around the room, I had to pause and
            wonder if I had gone crazy, a little drunk perhaps?
          </p>

          <Vortigern>"Down here" The voice said again.</Vortigern>

          <p>
            I shot out of my own skin, jumping up onto the chair, like a mouse
            had just run across my toes. "Who is here!?" I demanded to know.
          </p>
          <Vortigern>
            "Down here, on top of your books." The voice said in same monotone
            pitch.
          </Vortigern>

          <p>
            ".... The.. Skull!?" My eyes fixed to the skull I had placed on-top
            of the books. There was nothing unusual about it really. It did not
            move, the jaw stayed in placed, no eyes appeared in the sockets.
            There was a small amount of magical energy given off, it seemed no
            different from any other magic item.
          </p>

          <p>"Your first time meeting a sealed spirit?" The skull asked.</p>

          <p>"....Yes?" I replied a little unsure if I was being tricked.</p>

          <p>
            "Ahaha, well you seem like a smart girl, what do you think I am?" He said his tone finally changing, he sounded old, the kind of old man who might pass into death from a sharp wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Did... Someone trap your spirit into this skull? Was it your
            skull?.." I was not sure I wanted to know the answer to my second question.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, you are a sharp one. Yes my spirit was bound to my skull as part of an uncommon funeral process. The
            materials needed are rather rare, and the process was only achieved at the end of our civilization. I think the results speak for themselves, I am dead but not gone from this plane." He explained a little proudly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Can you still use magic? Can you move? How long have you been
            dead?" I had a thousand more questions, who wouldn't in this kind of situation? 
          </p>
          <p>
            "I suppose these are normal questions since it is your first time.
            Very well, I cannot use magic directly, I would need a medium to act
            though or a source of mana which I am attached to. I cannot move.
            Hmm hard to say really, I continued as I am currently for a few
            civilizations before being left inside that witches study."
          </p>

          <Tisiel>"A few civilizations? Not years? Or centuries?" I interrupted very confused.</Tisiel>
          <Vortigern>
            "Yes, I five in total if I include my own, I guess I never lived though the whole of my own civilizations time. It looks like you have
            found items with a similar design to a few I know." He confirmed.
          </Vortigern>
{/* Vortigern, Tisiel */}
          <p>
            "This is a lot to take in.. So the study became your second tomb?
            What about your first?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh, Don't think it has escaped me that most of the items here are
            taken from the tombs of the dead. Trying to raid my tomb? This is my
            resting place, this skull. My people did not believe that we took
            anything physical into the next life."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I could tell you about the location of another tomb if that is what
            your interest is. The civilization that took over from my own buried
            their dead in pyramid shaped tombs. First the person who had died,
            then followed by their servants, guards and what ever else they
            would be taking to their next life with them."
          </p>

          <p>
            Unable to resist, I spent the whole night chatting to a skull, well
            the person bond to the skull. Gwrtheyrn was his name but since it
            was a bit of a mouthful we agreed to call him Vortigern, not much
            better but he seemed fussy about what he would be called. I managed
            to copy down to a rough map of where the tomb should be.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- Arena -->  */}
          <p>
            Todays lesson started with an announcement, there would be arena
            team matches, those who where training to be non-combat mages did
            not need to join. The combat mages where expected to join, it was a
            good time to be noticed by merchant companies, mercenary groups &
            most importantly dukes. The first year matches where put on between
            second year matches which where the main draw of the arena matches.
            It would still be good to stand out in front of these people if you
            wanted to work with them in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            First things first he would need 3 teams mates. They must all be
            combat mages & first years. The first person I could think of was
            Reingard. He was the only other house mate I had talked to before
            that was a combat mage. Ralsan wanted to become a farmer, Tisiel was
            not made for combat, she would one day fight though skeleton
            warriors but no time soon. Shrorlei despite meeting her I have no
            had time to talk to.
          </p>

          <p>I decided I had to see if Reingard knew anyone else.</p>

          <p>
            "So, you are telling me you have an older brother in the academy,
            yet you still ended up in the cliff side?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I might have an older brother, but that doesn't mean he likes me.
            Anyway the point is we can recruit other people at the arena."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I mean, I guess that will work if we see what role they want to be
            and make a team around that. Speaking of what are you good at?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "So you asked me to make a team without knowing what I was good at?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Guarding. Just wanted to see if you thought it was something else."
          </p>

          <p>
            "No, I know my strengths, I will be the tank for the party. But what
            about you Otto?"
          </p>

          <p>"Melee damage, and some support."</p>

          <p>That same day we went to the area to pick up some new members.</p>
