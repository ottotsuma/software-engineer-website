            After having arrived back in my room from the dinner party I removed
            the grey satin dress, shoulderless hour-glass shaped to fit my
            waist, flowing off my hips giving me gliding wings down to my calfs
            if I walked too quickly. The thought of one day being able to just
            glide up into the sky with nothing but my foot steps made me feel
            like a kid again playing at magic, the reality was that using mana
            was much more exserting then I had imagined in my make believe
            worlds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Slipping into my room wear and feeling much more like my self again,
            with my collections of tombs, bones, nick-nacks and skulls to greet
            me back into what I enjoyed most, solving the mysteries they
            presented. Settling down into an old wooden chair by my study table,
            I always wrap my hands around the curved handle, old habits.
          </p>

          <p>"Well it's not quite as orderly as my study but I approve."</p>

          <p>
            Stopping and looking around the room, I had to pause and wonder if I
            had gone crazy, perhaps a little drunk.
          </p>

          <p>"Down here"</p>

          <p>
            I shot out of my own skin, jumping up onto the chair. "Who is
            here!?"
          </p>

          <p>"Down here, I on top of your books."</p>

          <p>
            ".... The.. Skull!?" My eyes fixed to the skull on the books,
            nothing unusual about it really. It did not move, the jaw stayed in
            placed, no eyes appeared in the sockets. There was a small amount of
            magical energy given off, it seemed no different from any other
            magic item.
          </p>

          <p>"Your first time meeting a sealed spirit?"</p>

          <p>"....Yes?"</p>

          <p>
            "Ahaha, well you seem like a smart girl, what do you think I am?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Did... Someone trap your spirit into this skull? Was it your
            skull?.."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well you are sharp. Yes my spirit was bound to my skull as part of
            my peoples funeral process. It was not a common process because the
            materials needed are rather rare, so it is reserved for only those
            who could afford it. I think the results speak for themselves, I am
            dead but not gone from this plane."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Can you still use magic? Can you move? How long have you been
            dead?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I suppose these are normal questions since it is your first time.
            Very well, I cannot use magic directly I would need a medium to act
            though or a source of mana which I am attached to. I cannot move.
            Hmm hard to say really, I continued as I am currently for a few
            civilizations before being left inside that witches study."
          </p>

          <p>"A few civilizations? Not years? Or centuries?"</p>

          <p>
            "Yes, I mean 5 in total if I include my own. It looks like you have
            found items from some of them."
          </p>

          <p>
            "This is a lot to take in.. So the study became your second tomb?
            What about your first?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh, Don't think it has escaped me that most of the items here are
            taken from the tombs of the dead. Trying to raid my tomb? This is my
            resting place, this skull. My people did not believe that we took
            anything physical into the next life."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I could tell you about the location of another tomb if that is what
            your interest is. The civilization that took over from my own buried
            their dead in pyramid shaped tombs. First the person who had died,
            then followed by their servants, guards and what ever else they
            would be taking to their next life with them."
          </p>

          <p>
            Unable to resist, I spent the whole night chatting to a skull, well
            the person bond to the skull. Gwrtheyrn was his name but since it
            was a bit of a mouthful we agreed to call him Vortigern, not much
            better but he seemed fussy about what he would be called. I managed
            to copy down to a rough map of where the tomb should be.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- Arena -->  */}
          <p>
            Todays lesson started with an announcement, there would be arena
            team matches, those who where training to be non-combat mages did
            not need to join. The combat mages where expected to join, it was a
            good time to be noticed by merchant companies, mercenary groups &
            most importantly dukes. The first year matches where put on between
            second year matches which where the main draw of the arena matches.
            It would still be good to stand out in front of these people if you
            wanted to work with them in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            First things first he would need 3 teams mates. They must all be
            combat mages & first years. The first person I could think of was
            Reingard. He was the only other house mate I had talked to before
            that was a combat mage. Ralsan wanted to become a farmer, Tisiel was
            not made for combat, she would one day fight though skeleton
            warriors but no time soon. Shrorlei despite meeting her I have no
            had time to talk to.
          </p>

          <p>I decided I had to see if Reingard knew anyone else.</p>

          <p>
            "So, you are telling me you have an older brother in the academy,
            yet you still ended up in the cliff side?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I might have an older brother, but that doesn't mean he likes
            me.Anyway the point is we can recruit other people at the arena."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I mean, I guess that will work if we see what role they want to be
            and make a team around that. Speaking of what are you good at?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "So you asked me to make a team without knowing what I was good at?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Guarding. Just wanted to see if you thought it was something else."
          </p>

          <p>
            "No, I know my strengths, I will be the tank for the party. But what
            about you Otto?"
          </p>

          <p>"Melee damage, and some support."</p>

          <p>That same day we went to the area to pick up some new members.</p>
