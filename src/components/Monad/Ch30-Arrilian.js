          <h4>Arrilian</h4>
          {/* Arrilian Sirillin - head of the first years at the academy, 68 years old from the kingdom, noble. */}
          <p>
            I had no idea how to reply to Arrilian. He was the last person I
            expected to see, as the head of the first years I figured he was
            always busy. Since I could not really refuse him, I had to follow
            him. He took me into the arena, not though the normal entrance but
            one I never really noticed until the stones moves apart when his
            mana touched it. We walked up a very wide staircase and though a
            double door. The room inside was huge. With tables, chairs and even
            small kitchen areas. "What is this place?" I could not help but ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The VIP room, though that door is the viewing platform, the large
            one you would of see the head of the school and myself sitting on
            during your initial trials." He said while sitting down at a small
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah sorry, I guess I was kind of concentrating on my fight, I never
            really noticed." I said, having forgot anything apart from the fight
            it's self. I sat on the other chair with him at the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So tell me, how did a monster eating plant suddenly appear in the
            small research lab by the farms?" He said in a casual voice now.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well, Ralsan took me into the lab to test lightning spells on
            seeds. He brought the monster eating plant seeds out because, he
            said they where cheap and hard to germinate but not too hard. After
            the germination process he asked me to stimulate the sapling with
            lighting to see if we could get it to grow. Well, the plant shooting
            up suddenly was the result." I said telling the truth as it would of
            been to everyone in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I see. I am not an expert on lightning. Or the research behind
            farming. It seems the field of study has come along way if that is
            the case." He said with no real reaction to my story.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah I do not know either. You see Ralsan is the real farmer I was
            just helping out. He said they had lightning mages before but since
            I was the only one around I am not sure what he was working on
            before." Which was true.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mm. That is true, a majority of the mages have been moved due to a
            change in policy." He nodded as if what I said made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, it seems it has had quite an impact on the farming team. The
            lab was almost empty lucky." I said not thinking too much about it,
            just how awkward this was.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah. Well for now there is nothing that can be done to change it.
            Hmm, I guess. While Lenne has asked me to let you stay in the
            farming club and I agreed at the time. More changes are coming. The
            time for you to chose between combat and farming might be coming
            sooner then you realise. I do not mean to pressure you, but. I felt
            it right to warn you. I have heard you where doing well in the
            farming club, if you decide to stay I will sign your transfer. Just,
            be careful. Misfortune follows you it seems." He smiled at the end.
            Always awkward.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems he is worried the tomb effected my mental state. Kinda
            feels like he was pushing me away from combat. Maybe I am just over
            thinking it. Either way It seems like he does not think I have
            changed to a new class. I was glad he did not force me to give up
            combat right then and there or kick me out of the farming club, I
            still feel kind of conflicted about them both. Either way I need a
            new weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I headed down into the area armory under the arena. As always there
            was low level weapons lined up along the walls, since the items are
            just inspected by students there was junk items mixed in with basic
            items but nothing rare or above. Those items get filtered out to
            either be used by the academy or sold to Alden's government. I
            looked though the warhammers again. I thought it was a good idea
            last time, the histories where full of inquisitors which needed to
            taken in rouge mages, their builds where great counter to mages.
            Only after trying to match their builds I came to understand they
            very specialized and really hard to use at a low level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked around thinking to myself less looking at the weapons as
            time passed. Even if the histories contains lightning mages non of
            them had the same class as me. What kind of weapon would even match
            a class that is a mix between lightning mage and farmer? Honestly
            the combination sounded silly...
          </p>
          <p>
            Farmers use axes, plows, scythe, spade, sickle. Those where the ones
            that could be used as a weapon but non of them really worked well
            compared to warhammers, battle-axes, long swords, bows and maces.
            Even a spear would be a better choice. WHAT AM I THINKING!? What
            kind of mage could walk into battle holding a spade or a plow and
            not feel embarrassed. What kind of damage is a spade going to do to
            a fully armored knight.
