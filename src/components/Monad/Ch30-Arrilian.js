          <h4>Arrilian</h4>
          {/* Arrilian Sirillin - head of the first years at the academy, 68 years old from the kingdom, noble. */}
          <p>
            I had no idea how to reply to Arrilian. He was the last person I
            expected to see, as the head of the first years I figured he was
            always busy. Since I could not really refuse him, I had to follow
            him. He took me into the arena, not though the normal entrance but
            one I never really noticed until the stones moves apart when his
            mana touched it. We walked up a very wide staircase and though a
            double door. The room inside was huge. With tables, chairs and even
            small kitchen areas. "What is this place?" I could not help but ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The VIP room, though that door is the viewing platform, the large
            one you would of see the head of the school and myself sitting on
            during your initial trials." He said while sitting down at a small
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah sorry, I guess I was kind of concentrating on my fight, I never
            really noticed." I said, having forgot anything apart from the fight
            it's self. I sat on the other chair with him at the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So tell me, how did a monster eating plant suddenly appear in the
            small research lab by the farms?" He said in a casual voice now.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well, Ralsan took me into the lab to test lightning spells on
            seeds. He brought the monster eating plant seeds out because, he
            said they where cheap and hard to germinate but not too hard. After
            the germination process he asked me to stimulate the sapling with
            lighting to see if we could get it to grow. Well, the plant shooting
            up suddenly was the result." I said telling the truth as it would of
            been to everyone in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I see. I am not an expert on lightning. Or the research behind
            farming. It seems the field of study has come along way if that is
            the case." He said with no real reaction to my story.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah I do not know either. You see Ralsan is the real farmer I was
            just helping out. He said they had lightning mages before but since
            I was the only one around I am not sure what he was working on
            before." Which was true.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mm. That is true, a majority of the mages have been moved due to a
            change in policy." He nodded as if what I said made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, it seems it has had quite an impact on the farming team. The
            lab was almost empty lucky." I said not thinking too much about it,
            just how awkward this was.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah. Well for now there is nothing that can be done to change it.
            Hmm, I guess. While Lenne has asked me to let you stay in the
            farming club and I agreed at the time. More changes are coming. The
            time for you to chose between combat and farming might be coming
            sooner then you realise. I do not mean to pressure you, but. I felt
            it right to warn you. I have heard you where doing well in the
            farming club, if you decide to stay I will sign your transfer. Just,
            be careful. Misfortune follows you it seems." He smiled at the end.
            Always awkward.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems he is worried the tomb effected my mental state. Kinda
            feels like he was pushing me away from combat. Maybe I am just over
            thinking it. Either way It seems like he does not think I have
            changed to a new class. I was glad he did not force me to give up
            combat right then and there or kick me out of the farming club, I
            still feel kind of conflicted about them both. Either way I need a
            new weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I headed down into the area armory under the arena. As always there
            was low level weapons lined up along the walls, since the items are
            just inspected by students there was junk items mixed in with basic
            items but nothing rare or above. Those items get filtered out to
            either be used by the academy or sold to Alden's government. I
            looked though the warhammers again. I thought it was a good idea
            last time, the histories where full of inquisitors which needed to
            taken in rouge mages, their builds where great counter to mages.
            Only after trying to match their builds I came to understand they
            very specialized and really hard to use at a low level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked around thinking to myself less looking at the weapons as
            time passed. Even if the histories contains lightning mages non of
            them had the same class as me. What kind of weapon would even match
            a class that is a mix between lightning mage and farmer? Honestly
            the combination sounded silly...
          </p>
          <p>
            Farmers use axes, plows, scythe, spade, sickle. Those where the ones
            that could be used as a weapon but non of them really worked well
            compared to warhammers, battle-axes, swords, bows and maces. Even a
            spear would be a better choice. WHAT AM I THINKING!? What kind of
            mage could walk into battle holding a spade or a plow and not feel
            embarrassed. What kind of damage is a spade going to do to a fully
            armored knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was walking around I heard some of the students talking about
            me. "He's the strength mage that cannot even cast spells any more.
            He should just forget about a weapon and stick to farming." One boy
            said. "I heard from a third year he killed his friends in a tomb,
            God must of cursed him because of that." Another followed up. "Yeah,
            he was part of the group that found the pyramid, do you remember a
            girl died that time also." Another said.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not want to reply, while it was not true there were truths
            mixed in which would make it pointless to try and correct them. I
            guess it did look from the outside that two young girls died both
            times with me around... I should count myself lucky Tsuma did not
            run away when I came back..
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking seriously I had plant soldiers as long as I could get my
            hands on some seeds, shouldn't be too hard. A method for recovering
            mana in combat. Maybe a ranged weapon, while the seed-soldiers go
            ahead? But the lighting-seeds is not a long ranged spell really. Ahh
            why is this so hard!? I picked up a spear for now, I guess this will
            do. Inspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            *Ping* [Spear - Wooden shaft and metal head. +1 physical damage.] As
            I thought, it was a junk item. I could spend awhile inspecting the
            spears seeing if one with a good stat or basic tier had slipped
            though as they tend to do.
          </p>
          <p>[Spear: -1HP per hit.] What the hell?</p>
          <p>[Spear: 5% chance to break on use.] Nope.</p>
          <p>
            [Sharp Stick: 0.5% chance of inflicting infection.] That is just
            mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            [<font className="Normal">Big Spear</font>: +1 Charisma.] Err, it
            has a stat increase but something feels wrong about using this. I
            took the spear with me, I guess I was lucky to find a stat increase.
            I wouldn't of taken it but I remembered that Charisma has an effect
            on command which is used to give orders to summons. Maybe my seed
            soldiers would benefit from this. Either way it was free so work
            trying.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took it out at the desk where it was signed next to my name.
            Seeing someone had already signed my warhammer out as missing in
            action. At least I did not have to explain it again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was walking off when I heard another comment directed at me this
            time "Gonna kill your next victim with that? They should of kicked
            you out of the academy." I just kept walking and left the armory.
            They could only throw words around while there were staff here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Man, I never thought people would recognize me. Even after the
            pyramid where Shrorlei died no one noticed any of us like this. I
            walked off around the training areas, I guess I have some spare time
            today since farming ended early. I want to try the command
            challenge. Maybe it will give me some hints about how to use my
            seed-soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran up to the command stone and tapped it. Inside I was taken to a
            military camp, similar looking to the ones I passed on the way to
            the academy. I have not thought about Effi and the others for a long
            time, I hope they are doing well. I was in front of a group of 10
            men holding spears and wearing leather armor. A guy tapped me on the
            shoulder. "Alright sargent, just get these men though the obstacle
            course course and you will get a pass and move to the next level." A
            man in about his 40's said to me wearing metal armor.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Erm, okay. Go though the obstacle course." I commanded to the men
            in front of me. With that they ran down the middle of the obstacle
            course without going near a single obstacle, coming to a stop at the
            other end.
          </p>
          <p>"First time commanding summons?" The man next to me asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah." I admitted a little annoyed at the men who just ran down the
            middle, but he had just called them summons. I guess nothing in the
            training area's is real but summons? Were they all just summons?
          </p>
          <p>
            "If your command points are high enough summons will do as you ask,
            but what you ask them to do cannot be left to their interpretation.
            The lower the level of the summon the easier it is to control but
            the dumber it acts." He said. Try again but be very clear about what
            you want them to do. He clapped his hands and the men re-appeared on
            front of me.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time I gave instructions about which obstacles to do in order
            and where they should go. They ran though the course again, except
            this time they ran into the last obstacle. It was a wall they had to
            climb. They ran into it and kept running...
          </p>
          <p>"Again" The man shouted and the simulation reset.</p>
          <p>
            This time I ran along side the group, giving them short
            instructions. "Run with me, stand still. Jump over this gap." They
            moved as a group which was nice, I was glad I did not have to give
            individual commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Pass, well done." The man said. And like that the place reset
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Welcome to the 2nd level." The man said again. "The level of the
            summons are still 0 but you will have to defeat that identical group
            over there." He pointed at a group of ten other men who looked the
            same as my group. The same size, height, weight, clothing. I guess
            they really are summons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like last time. I failed over and over. It was fine though
            because each time I learned something new from the man. I tried to
            ask his name but all he said was "Concentrate on your work." So I
            took to naming him 'Knight'. The rank above sargent in the Aldenese
            army. Creative I know. Eventually I had passed, I learned a great
            amount about commanding summons. The third level though, it looked
            the same as the second however Knight's instructions ruined my fun.
            "The third level is the same as the second, except the level of the
            summons has been increased. I am sorry but you do not have enough
            command points to carry on."
          </p>
          <p>
            I re-appeared outside of the training stone. [Item acquired, command
            token x1]. Oh at least I got a reward for it. It was a small coin
            with 'Command token x1' written on in Aldenese. Not sure what is for
            I tried to ask one of the near by students on their own. "Hey, sorry
            do you know what command tokens are for?" I asked hoping he was not
            like the others.
          </p>
          <p>"Your first time?" He asked back.</p>
          <p>"Yeah, sorry." I said again.</p>
          <p>
            "It's okay. You can trade them for items from the military store.
            They have one set up in each camp and the academy. You can exchange
            them for items, the rewards are just given at levels they selected
            so they can keep track of potential recruits. Honestly though, it's
            free stuff, so no one minds." He said. "Got stuck at level three
            right?" He asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Yeah, I guess every one does." I said with a smile.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah. I mean it would be hard to get even a single command point by
            level 10, let alone for a mage. They just put that token on the end
            of level two so you look in their store. Tempt you to collect the
            coins and by doing so push you towards them." He said with a shrug.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well I guess it works because I want to see what they have." I said
            laughing a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            He nodded and said good luck as I went over to see what was at the
            store. Another thing Lubin conveniently forgot to mention. I should
            cut him some slack maybe he is just very busy. I walked over to a
            stall set up between the command training area and the group
            training area. I guess it made sense, that is what the military
            would be most interested in. Personal glory was for sporting matches
            in the area, war is about a groups strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weirdly the stall was unmanned. It was a circle with manastones held
            to the stall with metal chains and a coin box. It had a hole for
            different coins and a tray at the bottom, I guess where the items
            you buy come out. Unsure what to really do I decided to touch the
            manastone.
          </p>

            [Menu: Command, Group, Single Combat, Monster Eradication, Other.]

            <font className="Rare"> Military Registration</font>.]
          </p>
          <p>
            The last one was not even an option, it was labeled as a rare item
            but it was free...
          </p>
          <p>
            The options here made sense. The class boobs was a real surprise
            though. Inside were books that let you change your class from mage,
            fighter or rouge into a new class like I had done. Someone at the
            academy, maybe Lubin? Had told me some families had their own
            classes. I guess it makes sense for the military to have some too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The list contained classes like: Commander, Cartographer, Standard
            bearer, Minnesingers and other support and leadership styled
            classes. They were all very expensive, clearly these were not
            suppose to be brought without showing talent for command.

          {/* 	Royal Adviser, Mayor, Librarian, Diplomat, Linguist */}
          <p>
            Being curious I decided to look though the group and duel shops. I
            was there for the rest of the afternoon more or less, the items on
            sale ranged from basic tier all the way up to epic tier. The problem
            was the cost was impossible. The Miscellaneous section contained one
            time use items and even materials for making other items. I kept the
            command token for now, I guess I could look up command roles and see
            if there are any builds I could try out. With my seed soldiers and
            odd lighting spells being a commander might be a better way for me
            to hide my new class after joining the military.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before heading back for the night I wanted to try monster hunting
            again. I might not be able able to gain any rewards, experience or
            anything useful. On the off chance I did not get mugged for my
            tokens that would be a bonus but I wanted to test the seed soldiers.
            Yes the farm pests give experience technically, but they where such
            a low level it was hardly a fair test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Running over to the monster hunting stone it was still quite busy,
            with students flocked around it. It was one of the major training
            areas so even with its constant bullying people where still going to
            give it a try. I touched the stone and arrived in the same
            rainforest setting. I had 1 hour and honestly after that I was going
            to go to bed anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran into the jungle not really picking a direction just hoping to
            run into something useful. All I had on me was the robe, spear and
            storage ring from the tomb. The mask was in my inventory, while I
            often just kept it in my bag at my waist it was easier like this. in
            one of the small pouches I had some bacon-plant seeds from the farm.
            I did not take too long before I found a colony of acid ants. This
            was perfect! They were similar to the rats on the farm, in as much
            as they could explode. The difference was they exploded when their
            health was low, and by doing so would cause their tokens to
            disappear. You had to kill the ants before they exploded and that
            was not an easy task unless you had either a counter element or a
            really strong attack to hit them with before they could detonate.

          </div>

            I had non of these things. However I did not plan on collecting
            tokens from the start, the other students would usually avoid them
            because it was high risk and low reward. I picked out two of the
            bacon-plant seeds and cast 'seed-to-soldiers'. Only one of the seeds
            transformed. I guess the explains the descriptive text. One seed to
            one soldier, not one soldier per seed. I tried to cast it again on
            the next seed and a warning popped up.

            [Doing this will unsummon your current summon. Do you wish to
            proceed? Yes/No (Do not show this again [])]
          </p>
          <p>
            I could only have one at once!? I thought it would be like other
            spells were you could cast and use them as long as you had the
            mana...
          </p>
          <p>
            There goes my dream of having a little plant army defending me.
            Still one is better then none. Maybe I could give him a weapon? Too
            late to think about that now. I commanded the summoned plant-soldier
            to follow me. Since it was an ant colony they really out numbered
            us, I was not sure I could kill one before they swarmed us really.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wonder. The soldier is a plant technically. So... 'Lighting-Grow'.
            He did not grow. Why did lots of my mana just leave me!? AHHHH!!
            "Just go kill that ant!!!" I was so frustrated. Why would it take my
            mana and not grow the plant?
          </p>
          <p>[1 token gained.]</p>
          <p>
            Summoning him is not cheap in the first place! Why the hell are all
            these spells so expensive if they don't do anything in combat!?
          </p>
          <p>[1 token gained.]</p>
          <p>
            They are not even amazing for farming, I cant grow tons of food, the
            cost is too high and it's too tedious. A water and fire mage can do
            the same work much cheaper!
          </p>
          <p>[1 token gained.]</p>
          <p>Wait. What? Token? Huh?</p>
          <p>
            I turned to see what was going on, the seed-soldier had killed the
            ant I asked it to. And the ones that got in it's way. There was
            nothing left, acid splashed all over the ground, rocks and plants
            near by. Some corroding slowly before my eyes. I guess a bunch more
            exploded on him? How did he kill that many ants though?
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat and thought about it for awhile, while my mana was recovering.
            Just summoning the seed-soldier cost more then germinate and grow
            together. Which was fair. How did grow cost twice as much as normal
            though? When it did nothing...{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Wait. Does it work like a buff just for plants!? I have to try this
            again! For testing purposes...
          </p>
          {/* <p>Lightning germination: Stimulate a target into germinating.</p> */}
          {/* During germination, repair processes are activated to deal with accumulated DNA damage. - Kind of heal & Quality */}
          {/* <p>Lightning growth: Force the target to grow.</p> */}
          {/* Increases quality of plant & stats given - buff spell */}
          {/* <p>Lightning harvest: Harvest the target.</p> */}
          {/* Execute and take the drops */}
          <p>
            I waited for my mana to recover before doing it again. I grew
            another bacon-plant seed into a soldier, then cast growth on him.
            Again, around 20 mana had left my body. I told him to go kill an ant
            like before and watched carefully this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seed-soldier had run directly at the ant I told it to kill.
            Ignoring all the other ants which at first made angry noises then
            started to try and bite or spit acid at him. I keep thinking him,
            but it's a plant so is it both? Who cares? Concentrate. After
            getting to the target ant he slammed his foot down on the ants head.
            These were not normal ants, they were tough. They were as tall as my
            shin on all their legs when they stood up I guess they could reach
            my knee or thigh. However the seed-soldier's foot had crushed the
            ants head. Not fully, it was not in pieces but broken and being
            pressed on, quite a gross sight really to see acid and insect parts
            falling from it's head.
          </p>
          <p>[1 token gained.]</p>
          <p>
            That explains the tokens. As the other ants crawled across a short
            battle ensued, with the seed soldier slamming his fists and kicks
            into the ants while they shot acid at him pealing away his plant
            like skin, biting at his bacon like insides. Soon he was ripped to
            pieces but so were several ants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ant's level varied from 1 ~ 5 usually, the majority being level
            1. At least that is what the records say. Since the ants are inside
            a training area the records are likely to be correct in this case. I
            was going to die if I fought like the seed-soldier did.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made a new seed-soldier and used him as a shield. I cast grow on
            him and walked forward with my spear pointing out beyond us. I was
            not worried about losing it, even if you died you would keep all
            your items, minus the tokens. Imagine if when you died you dropped
            your items, all your clothes would be gone and you'd be standing
            naked in front of all the other students.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first I thought my plan would work, I stabbed at the ants and the
            seed-soldier took the hits for me, hitting the ants back when he
            could. I cast lighting seed at the ants. I missed. Baldly. It went
            down a hole the ants were coming out of before. While I did not mind
            dieing in here too much, the death by a thousand ant bites would be
            too painful, I couldn't cause enough damage to hundreds of ants to
            make them explode and get it over with. I could feel the lighting
            seed leeching mana from the ants on its way down, far too many ants.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran leaving behind the seed-soldier to slow them down. I ran back
            onto the path to the village. The monsters never came into the
            village they just kind of lost interest, so I ran back towards the
            hand in point.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was running as fast as I could. On the way to the little starting
            village I saw a group of students standing in the path. Maybe they
            could help? I ran towards then when I noticed curly blonde hair on
            one boy, I knew him. Linhart. He had made it back from the tomb, and
            gone back to stealing tokens!? I don't know why but I thought he
            would of changed. I did not know the other students around him but I
            did not care, I only had one chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran towards them and threw out a lighting seed in their direction,
            I didn't care if it landed or not. They finally noticed I was not
            slowing down, but it was too late. They stood in front of my path
            ready to demand my tokens just like before, the lighting ball had
            made him dodge to the side thinking it was an attack and I used that
            to jump into the middle of them all.
          </p>
          <p>"Well look who it is. Murder." Linhart said in disgust.</p>
          <p>
            Murder? Had he damaged his head on the way back or something!?
            "Enjoy the present." I said back. He looked confused, the confusion
            turned to anger and he went to hit me before one of the boys
            shouted. "Look at all those acid ants! What the hell did he lure
            them here!?"
          </p>
          <p>
            I fell to the ground, and picked a seed out of my bag. I grew it
            into a soldier and Linhart was pinned down by the thing, I had not
            boosted it stats but it was enough to hold him, it only took seconds
            before the acid ants were on top of all of us. They bite and spat
            acid as the other students fought back I watched as Linhart screamed
            while the ants bit him. Maybe it was too much but clearly he had
            been spreading lies about me. It was only a training area. One of
            the ants was about explode, so I jumped myself on top of it and went
            out in a flash of green acid. My HP hit zero faster then you could
            blink and I appeared back outside the training area, no worse for
            ware physically and the only thing missing was the tokens I had
            collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing around here was not a good idea, not after what I just did.
            So I made my way though the students and back to my home as quick as
            I could. The last thing I heard was Linhart shouting "Where the fuck
            is he!?" at the other students as I made my get away.
