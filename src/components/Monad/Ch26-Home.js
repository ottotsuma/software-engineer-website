          <p>
            The trip home took a few days, Takeo's party system allowed us to
            see each others health which was really useful. From what he told me
            though was because of the large level difference the low levels
            monsters gave him zero experience towards a level up so I would also
            receive zero experience. Along with that any high level monsters I
            was unable to do a high level of contribution in the fight so the
            experience again was heavily weighted towards him. I did share with
            me that some humans have high level party skills and that helps
            negate these problems, but most either only grab the first level or
            stop at the third because that's all they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            We talked while we traveled about what I had found, I figured I
            would use this as practice for what I was going to tell the academy.
            I left out the parts of Tisiel and Reingard's ending as I was hoping
            the academy would be able to look for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had lost my academy traveling robes and with it any identification
            I had with me. Once we arrived back at the academy's walls which ran
            in a semi-circle around the side of the academy facing into the wild
            and stopped at the large valley near the bridge we had to cross when
            I first came to the academy. If I could see though all the buildings
            or I was stood on that bridge looking back I would of been able to
            see the small fortified building which houses the portal.
          </p>

          <p>
            The walls of the academy where old, and mostly for stopping students
            from leaving these days as nothing had attacked the academy that
            would require walls since it was first discovered. As part of the
            process for reentry I had to write a report on what happened since I
            had left and where my companions where. I told them a similar story
            to what I told Takeo.
          </p>

          <p>
            After waiting around for two hours Lubin and two other teachers had
            come out to collect and interview me. It was the head of the first
            years students Arrilian Sirillin and Lenne Klein who was in charge
            of student welfare. Arrilian as his names suggests was not an Alden
            but from the kingdom, being a talented noble he was able to study in
            the academy and just never left. He was tall, lean and now old with
            a beard the length of a forearm and soft blue eyes decorated with
            the wrinkles of age. Some say he is over 100 years old but only 68
            in appearance and records.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lenne was short. I was not tall and only 14 years old, while I could
            look Lenne directly in the eyes without having to tilt my head while
            sitting down. Her eyes where a kind of deep blue that looked as if
            she was always on the verge or tears or a day dream. She dressed in
            a child like manner which only made her look like a living doll. Her
            hair was in pigtails or bunches I was never good with women's hair,
            but a ribbon was wrapped around each and her hair let free after
            each ribbon. She wore an old Alden style dress which you could find
            people wear occasionally or for traditional events but would now
            only be found on actual dolls you would give to a small girl.
          </p>

          {/* dress image */}

          <p>
            After quick introductions and checks that I had suffered no physical
            damage that had not been taken care of yet Lenne insisted on doing a
            metal check before I told my story to which Arrilian looked annoyed
            as he just wanted to get on with getting information from me and
            Lubin was more respective to the idea.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am not sure how professional this examination was as she asked me
            my name, age, date of birth, where I was born, parents names,
            teachers name and a few questions about the lightning element.
            Arrilian plastered a fake smile across his face, he did not seem
            like a bad man just one who was aware he had bad social skills. I
            recited the story I had written down from the moment we left,
            leaving out how we really met the third years and out initial
            intentions. All the way up to meeting Takeo outside of the
            netherwood exit.
          </p>

          {/* Put them both inside storage rings? or find a way to get past the scanning of inventory for the items? */}

          <p>
            I had placed my new outfit in the storage ring before arriving while
            traveling with Takeo saying they where cold, he had given me warmer
            clothes I was going to return to him later but he insisted I burn
            them. I guess being in a tomb with dead bodies has left me with an
            unpleasant odor. In short I had left out anything that happened in
            the armory, along with the incident with the coffin and any mention
            of Vortigern chalking the discovery of the tomb to the third years.
          </p>

          <p>
            "An interesting story, the academy will have to explore the tomb of
            course, as if it is as you said crawling with undead a potential
            threat to the living and great opportunity for those of us who use
            the death element." Arrilian said. "Oh and one more thing, it might
            interest you to know that Linhart did not die after his fall from
            the bridge. He has in fact made it back to use claiming that he saw
            you die. A curious thing mind, it might be that there is illusion
            magic at play and not all of your friends have died." He places his
            hand on my shoulder, this was maybe meant to reassure me but felt
            like an accusation. It was hard to tell with Arrilian.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our meeting was over after that and I was taken off with Lenne and
            Lubin into the academy. Lenne said she would arrange for me to move
            residences if I wished, after all the residences at the cliffs was a
            dwindling number and the place seemed to bring the occupants back
            luck. Despite it being nice to have a lot of room to myself, she was
            right that place would just hold old memories now. So I asked to be
            moved to the wooded Niyoshon area, which was met with a shocked face
            from Lenne, but she said if I insisted that was the place I wanted
            to be that would be fine but if I changed my mind I should come back
            anytime and tell her.
          </p>

          <p>
            After Lenne parted ways with us Lubin asked "Why did you chose the
            Niyoshon area? She was offering you far better and closer residences
            to the academy. You didn't have to be so polite and pick some where
            near the cliff side if that was your intention. It wouldn't be a
            problem to move you close to the nobles quarters if you asked her." I
            caught the hint at the end, that even if I asked moving into the
            nobles quarters would be impossible and even moving near it would be
            a huge upgrade for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, I like the food." I relied simply, and being honest that is all
            I was thinking at the time. Lubin just laughed and put it down to me
            not haven eaten a good meal in a long time. Once we had reached the
            academy's market and shopping area Lubin headed back to the academy,
            he had to work after all. I headed into the Niyoshon area to get some
            food and then I would go to the cliffs to pack.
          </p>

          <p>
            I headed to the same place I had the ramen before. I picked another
            stand, a kind of want to try all of the foods here while I could.
            Niyoshon food is not popular in Alden and hard to find. You would
            think it would be easier being that Niyosho is not far from Alden but
            their diet is so different.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found a stand near by selling 'Oden' it just seemed to be a random
            assortment of foods in a warm broth. Honestly it was better then I
            thought it would be. I figured it would be like stew but the taste
            was more salty with soft boiled eggs, fish shaped as balls and an
            assortment of food I never even heard of before. He said the
            vegetable was 'Daikon', could of been anything for all I knew.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah you have already eaten! Damn it I was too slow." I turned around
            to see Tsuma standing behind me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "How did you know I was here? I just got back.. But it is great to
            see you!" I replied putting the chopsticks to one side not wanting
            her to see how badly I used them.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Mmm news travels fast in this little area, and you stand out." She
            replied. I took a look around and sure enough I was the only Alden
            here but this place was part of Alden, kind of. Surely others must
            come by.
          </p>

          <p>
            "So did you want to go get something?" I asked since she seemed
            upset that I had already eaten.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah, celebrate you came back okay, but you already ate." She said
            disappointed.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It's okay I haven't eaten real meals in a long time before this, I
            can eat twice. What do you want?" I smiled.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah really? Then take me to get Alden food." She said grabbing my
            arm and pulling me away.
          </p>

          <p>"Ah I haven't paid yet." I said.</p>

          <p>
            "Err, Ogoru!" She shouted to the man behind the stall. He nodded
            back. "It's done now let's go."
          </p>

          <p>"Then it's a date." I said.</p>

          <p>"A date!?"</p>

          <p>"Yeah, we are going out to eat together. It should be a date."</p>

          <p>"Mmm then lets go see the shrine afterwards, okay?"</p>

          <p>
            "Sure!" I replied and we headed off back in the direction of the
            academy. A shame she did not find me sooner but can't be helped.
          </p>

          <p>
            I showed her around some Alden style restaurants selling sausages,
            pork on the bone and white bread. These places were expensive, but I
            was hoping to pay with some of the gems I grabbed in the treasure
            room. Since they had no mana the academy had no interest themselves.
            Somehow we ended up in a republic style restaurant eating a course
            meal. I guess this trip out would cost me all my gems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The meal was really nice, nicer then any food I had in my life.
            Since Tisiel was gone I would be unable to safely sell the
            wood-death set I had stored away, maybe these gems where all I had
            to show from that trip. I tried to insist that I pay but before I
            could even take the gems out Tsuma had said she would pay since it
            was her treating me for coming back alive. I guess she can't be poor
            if she could afford to study in a foreign country.
