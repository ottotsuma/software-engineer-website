          <h4>Dinner</h4>
          <p>
            Otto could not help but stop listening to the conversation, his eyes
            had been caught and his full attention was now directly focused the
            woman who had just walked through the door. Stunning smooth shoulder
            length straight black hair, slightly tanned smooth skin, almond
            shaped eyes, as she looked around the room he could not help but
            admire how elegant and graceful she was moving about between the
            guests like a fairy. She had a slim waist and a beautiful dress, it
            was a deep blue and fitted against her curves. If he did not stop
            now he was going to be caught starring.
          </p>

          <p>
            He excused himself as hastily has he could and made his way across
            the room to try and strike a conversation with her only to be caught
            by old professor Farald, I heard from young Daniel you where curious
            about how the duel system works. Unable to escape he had to hope he
            could find her later.
          </p>

          <p>
            To his luck and amazement there was a beautiful fairy-like goddess
            of a woman was still there, she had taken an interest in their
            conversation. Using this opportunity he introduced himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hello, I am Otto a first year student, are you interested in this
            topic also?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, yes. I am very much so. I am" she paused for a moment, "you can
            call me Tsuma."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Nice to meet you Tsuma, your acescent are you from Leika? It's very
            loverly."
          </p>
          <p>"Yes, I came here as an exchange, I am in my second year here."</p>
          <p>
            "I must be off you two, if you need me for a longer discussion
            please leave me a message at my office, its in the research
            department I imagine you haven't been there before but anyone else
            should be able to point you in the right direction, please excuse
            me."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh no not at all professor, thank you for your knowledge." Both of
            the students gave a light bow as professor Farald made his way over
            to a group of other professors calling to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I believe the dinner is starting soon, would you like to join me?"
          </p>
          <p>"Ah that won't be possible the seats are arranged before hand."</p>
          <p>
            "How about a date? A short one, tonight after the dinner. I'd like
            to take you to a cafe and talk, I've never been to Leika so perhaps
            we can start there."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I..Yeah, I can do that. I'll wait for you under the autumn tree on
            your right as you leave through the main door."
          </p>
          <p>"Perfect."</p>

            Ding. Ding. Ding. "Please make your way into the dinning hall, name
            cards are at each place please find your own name card. A flag
            stands on each table you can match the flag to your invitation
            image."
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the hall was numerous tables with flags standing proud above
            them. A large red and white flag with a black stag, this must be me.
            On the table where places for 10, no doubt I would be unable to
            converse with those places too far from myself. My place was to the
            right on the inner side of the table to the hall, not that it
            mattered the outer side was still 4 tables away from the nearest
            wall. To my right Reingard would be sat and my left Ebba.
