          <h4>Dinner</h4>
          <Otto>
            The sound of Reingard and Tisiel flirting, Shrorlei groaning at them
            being embarrassing and Ralsan's laughter became dull in my ears. The
            sounds of the grand hall, the conversations, laughter and clanging
            of glasses all became dull. My body had become stiff, almost as if I
            had left my body the moment my eyes landed on a woman walking into
            the hall. She had midnight black, straight shoulder length hair and
            almond shaped eyes. She was wearing a deep blue dress which showed
            off her thin waist, and cut off at her shoulders giving a glimpse at
            her fresh snow white skin. She was so fairy like, seemingly gliding
            across the floor.
          </Otto>
          <Ralsan>
            "I think we lost him." Ralsan teased, I did not hear it at the time
            though.
          </Ralsan>
          <Otto>
            "Excuse me." I hastily replied without registering what Ralsan had
            said.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            I made my way between and around other groups which had congregated
            about the hall. Before I could reach my target however I was
            intercepted by old professor Farald.
          </Otto>
          <Farald>
            "Ah Otto! I heard from young Daniel you where curious about how the
            duel system works."
          </Farald>
          <Otto>
            "Ah, I was." I said trying to look past the professor to see if the
            girl had moved.
          </Otto>
          <Farald>
            "Oh are you no longer? I am quite busy you know, it's rare I come
            out of my lab for any event."
          </Farald>
          <Otto>
            "I still am! I'm sorry I thought I saw someone I knew..." I knew
            from Daniel that professor Farald was a hard man to get hold of,
            while that woman was clearly a one in a million goddess, the dinner
            party was still early.
          </Otto>
          <Farald>
            "Oh, I'm sure you'll have lots of time to reunite with your friends.
            presides I cannot be hanging around down here all night, we have VIP
            guests I have to meet and greet, it was my reason for coming to this
            event. However it's always nice to talk to an enthusiastic student."
            Farald said while pinching the end of his english style mustache, it
            was like a pencil mustache but with a small flick up in the middle
            giving it a bit more flare. "Well to state the obvious first, I of
            course did not build the ancient arena, despite how old I look.
            Around the edge of the arena, hidden under the seats, the creators
            installed a tube. This tube is connected to a controller, so that
            when the tube is filled with a continuous supply of mana the rules
            of the arena can be adjusted. The mana is what fuels its ability to
            teleport people to pre-set locations around the arena. I have been
            studying the device and it's magic carvings for years now. To tell
            you the truth, I have made a breakthrough recently that is why our
            VIP guests have come to our opening ceremony this year."
          </Farald>
          <Arrilian>
            "I knew I would find you here professor." A very old gentleman with
            a beard the length of a forearm interrupted professor Farald. "If
            you have to speak of your breakthrough tonight, let it be those who
            have traveled a long way to be here tonight. The first year
            student's will have at least 2 years to come ask you questions at a
            later time."
          </Arrilian>
          <Farald>
            "When you are right, you are right. Sorry boy, looks like I don't
            have time for questions right now. Come find me in the future if you
            have any." professor Farald patted me shoulder before leaving with
            the older gentleman.
          </Farald>
          <Otto>
            Well that was both fortuitus and disappointing, I must try to
            remember to ask him about his devices later. I am always forgetting
            things but surely I won't forget something so interesting? Ah focus!
            I looked around for her again, she had not made it far into the
            hall. There were people all around her who had come in with her,
            they were wearing unusual clothes, everyone had been asked to either
            wear formal wear or academy robes to the dinner but these people had
            turned up wearing overlapping robes? I was not sure, they all looked
            like foreigners however. The fairy-like doll girl was also a
            foreigner like them, so it made sense they came in together. Their
            skin was not so different, some tanned some pale, the main
            difference was their almond shaped eyes and midnight hair.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            I decidedly made my way over to her... I had wanted to make it look
            natural but I was nervous and excited, so maybe it was a little
            direct. Not to be mean to the other foreigners but it looked like
            their whole group was heading into the VIP hall also so I had little
            time to chit-chat before she would be gone. The first man to
            approach me to talk, I handed him my empty glass and thanked him,
            maybe that came across very rude, he was clearly not a waiter but I
            had to move quickly. He looked stunned and taken back, which was
            perfect so I could slip past him.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            Using that chance I walked right up to her, feeling my palms were
            damp and clammy I started to open and close them hoping they would
            dry out. The people around her moved to block her from me, before
            she pulled on one of their sleeves gently. Ah I guess I looked like
            I wanted to punch her? Opening and closing my hand like that walking
            right up to her, she has good friends that would protect her like
            that.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            "My apologies, I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to
            introduce myself and find out who you are. My names Otto a first
            year at the academy, did you come far to study here?" What a dumb
            question! Everybody came far to study here who didn't live in
            Banderdam! I looked into her eyes while asking the question, bright
            yellow. Did all foreigners have different colour eyes from us? Can't
            be, I would of noticed that before now... Right?
          </Otto>
          <Tsuma>
            "Who I am?" She stared at me for a little bit, I guess the question
            was quite rude when it's put like that... "You can call me Tsuma."
            She replied causing my nevers to calm a little and my heart to beat
            wildly. Okay maybe my nevers did not calm at all. "Quite far, I'm
            from Niyosho. Do you know it?"
          </Tsuma>
          <Otto>
            "Is it bad if I say no? Your accent is loverly though. W-Why did you
            pick Alden to study?"
          </Otto>
          <Tsuma>
            "Oh you don't know. Well I was interested in the 'witch' magic that
            is only taught here in Alden so I came here on exchange. If you want
            to find out about Niyosho we have a little version built in the
            woods to the west of the academy, I am in my 2nd year here and we
            will be going back at the end of this year so it's your only year to
            come and visit." She politely explained.
          </Tsuma>
          <Otto>
            I guess it is quite rude to not know someone elses country at all, I
            should visit when I walk back to the cliffside, she said it was in
            the woods. I wonder if it's the place with the wooden houses between
            the trees. I wonder if Niyosho is a giant wood... I can't ask
            something so silly, I'll look it up later. "I'd love to learn more
            about Niyosho! You've been here a year but perhaps you spent a lot
            of time studying? Maybe I could tell you about Alden or show you
            around, I guess it's kind of too late for that. How about we go on a
            date instead?" Did I really just ask that!? "A short one I mean,
            like after this dinner, just a cafe or something to talk about our
            countries not like a date date." I made it worse.
          </Otto>
          <Tsuma>
            "I..Yeah, I can do that. I'll wait for you under the autumn tree,
            the large white one with orange leaves on your right as you leave
            through the main door."
          </Tsuma>
          <Otto>"Perfect!"</Otto>

          {/* <!-- Tsuma has magic cat that turns black at night, white in the day and has purple eyes. --> */}

          {/* <!-- Call for dinner --> */}
          <p>
            Ding. Ding. Ding. "Please make your way into the dinning hall, name
            cards are at each place please find your own name card. A flag
            stands on each table you can match the flag to your invitation
            image."
          </p>
          <Otto>"Ah, then I will see you later on." I said.</Otto>
          <Tsuma>"Un. I'll be waiting." She replied before leaving.</Tsuma>
          <Otto>
            If shes going to be waiting should I be fashionably late? No, that
            would be a waste.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            I quickly made my way back over to Reingard, Tisiel, Shrorlei &
            Ralsan. "Sorry about that..." I said re-joining the group like that
            had not just noticed what I did.
          </Otto>
          <Ralsan>
            "So, did she break your heart? You know there are lots of pretty
            girls at the academy don't feel tooooo bad." Ralsan said as soon as
            I rejoined.
          </Ralsan>
          <Otto>
            "No, everything is fine. I'm meeting her later to talk about her
            home country." I explained with a little pride.
          </Otto>
          <Shrorlei>
            "Lots of pretty girls huh? What class are you taking again? I'm sure
            the sex ed classes were taught were we came from, are you being held
            back a year?" Shrorlei teased Ralsan.
          </Shrorlei>
          <Ralsan>
            "Oh lighten up, every one does it! Right Reingard?" Ralsan asked.
          </Ralsan>
          <Reingard>"When you find the one." Reingard replied.</Reingard>
          <Tisiel>"Awww." Tisiel injected.</Tisiel>
          <Ralsan>
            "You living trope. Defending fair maidens with your body and words.
            I'm sure you're very popular with the girls." Ralsan teased
            Reingard.
          </Ralsan>
          <Tisiel>"Aww, leave him alone." Tisiel injected again.</Tisiel>
          <Otto>
            Their bickering and laughter carried on into the dinning hall as we
            looked around for a table with a flag of, what is this? A Lutra?
            Who's idea was it to use beasts as the markers.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            Inside the hall was in-numerous tables with flags standing proud
            above them displaying a verity of beasts. On each table was places
            for 10. My place was to the right on the inner side of the table to
            the hall, not that it mattered the outer side was still 4 tables
            away from the nearest wall. To my right Reingard would be sat and my
            left Tisiel, maybe I should swap with one of them.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            From the lower, larger hall we were seated in we could see the
            second years in the next hall ahead of ours and ahead of them the
            teachers, their flags displaying various elemental symbols. The
            various guests, including too far away to see their faces but the
            people of Niyosho. The flag must of been their countries flag, [add
            the flag here]. The royal flag, the rumor that a prince was
            attending this academy this year must of been true.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            The dinner started off with me vs the whole group on who could name
            the most beasts from all the flags in the room. I was surprised,
            Tisiel who spends the majority of her time studying could barely
            name even the most common of beasts. Reingard who was also part of
            the combat classes was barely chipping in with answers. Ralsan knew
            the most of the four, naming and kinds of pests that would eat, dig
            up or otherwise ruin a farmers work. I guess that was to be expected
            of a mage studying farming as their primary topic. While Shrorlei
            held a different kind of surprise, able to name some of the more
            obscure beasts of the western regions of Alden, so I knew little to
            nothing of, being used on a few of the 2nd year tables, however just
            shrugged at the more common beasts used for the 1st year tables.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            Each table could seat ten, so we were not alone, before the beasts
            we could see had been named between us, and the hall had turned
            quiet. Up at the far end of the room standing among the VIP guests
            was the head master of the academy. He had
            started to welcome everyone officially to the academy, using some
            kind of magic device so his voice was no quieter or louder from
            where he stood to even the furthest reaches of the hall. Not all of
            the professors were sat with the headmaster, it seemed there were a
            few important guests he had to entertain tonight.
          </Otto>
