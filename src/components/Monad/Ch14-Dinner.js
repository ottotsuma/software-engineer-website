          <h4>Dinner</h4>
          <p>
            Otto could not help but stop listening to the conversation, his eyes
            had been caught and his full attention was now directly focused the
            woman who had just walked though the door. Stunning smooth shoulder
            length straight black hair, slightly tanned smooth skin, almond
            shaped eyes, as she looked around the room he could not help but
            admire how elegant and graceful she was moving about between the
            guests like a fairy. She had a slim waist and a beautiful dress, it
            was a deep blue and fitted against her curves. If he did not stop
            now he was going to be caught starring.
          </p>

          <p>
            He excused himself as hastily has he could and made his way across
            the room to try and strike a conversation with her only to be caught
            by old professor Farald, I heard from young Daniel you where curious
            about how the duel system works. Unable to escape he had to hope he
            could find her later.
          </p>

          <p>
            To his luck and amazement there was a beautiful fairy-like goddess
            of a woman was still there, she had taken an interest in their
            conversation. Using this opportunity he introduced himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hello, I am Otto a first year student, are you interested in this
            topic also?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, yes. I am very much so. I am" she paused for a moment, "you can
            call me Tsuma."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Nice to meet you Tsuma, your acescent are you from Leika? It's very
            loverly."
          </p>
          <p>"Yes, I came here as an exchange, I am in my second year here."</p>
          <p>
            "I must be off you two, if you need me for a longer discussion
            please leave me a message at my office, its in the research
            department I imagine you haven't been there before but anyone else
            should be able to point you in the right direction, please excuse
            me."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh no not at all professor, thank you for your knowledge." Both of
            the students gave a light bow as professor Farald made his way over
            to a group of other professors calling to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I believe the dinner is starting soon, would you like to join me?"
          </p>
          <p>"Ah that won't be possible the seats are arranged before hand."</p>
          <p>
            "How about a date? A short one, tonight after the dinner. I'd like
            to take you to a cafe and talk, I've never been to Leika so perhaps
            we can start there."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I..Yeah, I can do that. I'll wait for you under the autumn tree on
            your right as you leave though the main door."
          </p>
          <p>"Perfect."</p>

          {/* <!-- Tsuma has magic cat that turns black at night, white in the day and has purple eyes. --> */}

            Ding. Ding. Ding. "Please make your way into the dinning hall, name
            cards are at each place please find your own name card. A flag
            stands on each table you can match the flag to your invitation
            image."
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the hall was numerous tables with flags standing proud above
            them. A large red and white flag with a black stag, this must be me.
            On the table where places for 10, no doubt I would be unable to
            converse with those places too far from myself. My place was to the
            right on the inner side of the table to the hall, not that it
            mattered the outer side was still 4 tables away from the nearest
            wall. To my right Reingard would be sat and my left Ebba.
          </p>

          <h4>Cafe Date - Otto</h4>
          <p>
            I arrived at the cafe before the agreed time, there were lots of
            various cafes around, small and large selling breads, cakes and
            drinks of all kinds. One cafe I walked past had little figures
            placed on a tray on the table and on request the staff would put
            them into a glass where a small liquid explosion took place and the
            glass filled up.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the back was a large cat figure, this was another cafe where the
            building itself looked like a cat, it was so obvious when placed
            next to the other buildings I could see why Tsuma had agreed to meet
            outside this cafe, that way we would not get lost. I waited there
            for awhile watching small bird creatures breath out fire to toast
            bread, a lizard creature who's tail was cut off then fed a rat which
            caused it to grow back instantly. It never flinched or seemed to be
            in pain, the tail was then placed into a metal cup with some powder
            and whisked quickly. Soon enough multi-colored strings could be seen
            wrapping around each other to make what looked like fluffy ice cream
            with a foggy layer been given off to show just how cold it was.
          </p>

          <p>
            She came walking up the street in a black dress that stopped just
            past her knees, sleeves down to a triangle over the back of her
            hand, and a webbed pattern across the top of her chest. Something
            about it seems like the fashion of an Alden witch but something was
            a little off, no hat.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hey, you look really beautiful, what happened to your other dress?
            Was I suppose to change also?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, I had to change! That dress did not suit the place I wanted to
            go. You look good no need to change honestly."
          </p>

          <p>"Thank you. So where is it you had in mind?"</p>

          <p>
            "Here of course!" She said pointing to the large cat shaped
            building.
          </p>

          <p>
            I stared at the building again, a light brown and white cat with its
            eyes closed in a kind of smile laying down with its tail wrapped
            around itself. The door was in the side of the cat. "I... Was not
            expecting that."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, I love cats and I always wanted to try this place. You don't
            mind do you?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "No it's fine, let's go." I took her by the hand and headed to the
            door to the cat shaped cafe. I did not notice the other girl
            following us with her hood up over her head to cover her face.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the cat shaped cafe was full of cats. The cat shaped cafe was
            in fact a cat cafe. I don't know why I was so surprised. Maybe
            because the other cafes today where all so exotic to me that I did
            not expect a cafe just full of cats.
          </p>

          <p>
            We where sat near one of the walls with cats sleeping all over the
            place, every time you tried to get near one to pet it it would
            either not move and not care or run away at top speed. It seemed
            that throughout the day the cats have had enough customers come to
            play with them. While we sat there we drank a hot drink from the
            kingdom. It tastes of ginger, warmth and sweet flowers. I wish I
            knew how to make it, this would be the perfect companion at night
            when out traveling.
          </p>

          <p>
            A sudden flash of light appeared in the corner of my eye,
            "MEEEOWWWW." A black cat with bright purple eyes was on the desk as
            Tsuma was stoking it's head. "This is Byakko, he's my cat. I thought
            since non of the others want to play with us they might play with
            him."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Greetings to THE Otto I am Byakko." The cat spoke with an old deep
            voice that very much did not suit it's extremely cute face. Byakko
            bowed his head during his greeting and then face up to me looking me
            dead in the eye awaiting a response.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taken back a little, I stammered out "HE-llo I am named Otto, what
            do you mean by THE Otto?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh his Alden is a little rusty we only speak Leikan at home.. Off
            you go play!" She made a shooing motion with her hands as Byakko
            looked a little displeased muttering to himself "My Alden is just
            fine I can speak over 20 languages fluently..." He jumped onto the
            floor landing on his front paws and walking off proudly, head in the
            air and tail swishing back and forth.
          </p>

          <p>
            "So erm, why Alden? I mean there are magic academy's in most of the
            realms, why do people from all over come to Alden? Why did you
            come?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "That's easy, I came to try a new culture and because I really want
            to learn Alden magic! I read about it when I was a child and always
            wanted to try the magics that can be found here. As for others, I am
            not sure why they come but people go to magic academy's all over."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I didn't know Alden had magic you can't learn else where. Makes
            sense that people travel all over if that is the case."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh it is not like the magic is locked in one place, it is more like
            the expert in that magic taught there, the resources needed are
            there things like that. Lakia's academy is famous for summoning,
            speech, illusion and demon magic. Alden is famous for witch, charms
            and hex magic."
