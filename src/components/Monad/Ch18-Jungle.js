          <h4>Jungle Run</h4>
          <p>
            The group took me though the jungle, deeper in it became hard to
            find the key locations on the map, the monsters here are often
            weaker then the other area's this is maybe why the nobles set up
            there houses around this area. The jungle became thick quickly on
            this side, the nobles who often left the work of maintaining the
            woodland to their peasants on our home continent had all but
            abandoned the idea of doing themselves here. The next landmark we
            were looking for on the map was a large rock, descriptive I Know,
            but as far as I can translate these symbol's mean large rock and
            there is a picture of a rock that looks like the upturned claw.
          </p>

          <p>"You said a large rock."</p>

          <p>"Yes, well, it is somewhat big compared to other rocks."</p>

          <p>
            "The other landmarks where at least 3 times the height of a man,
            this is. Well it's not small but it's no taller then me, how were we
            suppose to find this in the jungle? The damn trees are taller, this
            cannot be it."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Trees? Yes, there are trees." The group looked to me as if I was
            the one who had gone mad. "No look at the map! There are no trees,
            no mention of trees. If this rock where in a grassy field you would
            call it a big rock. But this map is drawn without trees....Why no
            trees?"
          </p>

          <p>
            The group made their way the rock pointed, we followed it for a few
            hours before stopping for lunch. I could not take my mind off the
            trees. There were no trees. The map maker could not of missed them,
            even if he overlooked the trees because they where everywhere it
            would be wrong to call that rock big.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard "Still thinking about the rock? You have that face again
            like there is something to solve."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I just, but the rock IS smaller then the trees and no trees are
            mentioned. It would be weird to note the rock if there were the
            trees."
          </p>

          <p>Reingard - "Perhaps the book is older then you thought?"</p>

          <p>
            Bitting down on my lip "I suppose it could be but it doesn't make
            sense the book cannot be more then 100 years old. Yet it has a map
            of the academy with no trees, and was found on the main land. Too
            many mysteries."
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard "Relax a bit, we will find more answers when we arrive."
          </p>

          <p>
            Nodding, "yeah, you are right. As usual." I smiled at Reingard. It
            felt awkward to be around the others, I could not be myself with him
            like this. This time we would be looking for the landmark we came
            here for, it looked in the drawings stacks of squares stacked on top
            of each other becoming smaller to the top. Not unlike the pyramids
            found in Pocotcotcan literature.
          </p>

          <div className="pop">
            Landmark
            <img
              className="popOut"
              src="https://ottotsuma.github.io/images/inca2.png"
              height="400px"
              alt="Pyramid"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            It took half of the afternoon for us to find a small stream which
            took us to the pyramid, in among the trees and vines was a structure
            of squares slowly becoming smaller until on top stood the entrance
            way in the shape of a large stone square. Vegetation had grown all
            over the pyramid which had fallen hidden and unused in the jungle
            which had grown around it, I felt as this was more evidence to my
            theory but maybe I am just projecting my theory onto reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Explore or make camp? If we head back now we won't arrive back
            until late in the night, if we explore we might risk going without
            making camp." Reingard said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shrorlei - "We could make camp inside the entrance way, we could
            still retreat if we need to and it would shelter us a little more."
          </p>

          <p>
            Raina - "That sounds good, we brought food and water but not any
            camping equipment it would be good to save energy and mana on not
            having to build extensive shelter."
          </p>

          <p>
            The group was in agreement and we set up the stairs. It was not long
            before the complaints rolled in.
          </p>

          <p>Volker - "Carry me."</p>

          <p>Raina - "No. Carry me."</p>

          <p>Volker - "There are so many stairs!"</p>

          <p>
            Shrorlei - "The moss makes each step like standing on a pile of
            worms."
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard - "Can't we take a break, we have awhile until night fall."
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "47...48....49"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Do you HAVE to count!?"</p>

          <p>
            As soon as we arrived at the top the group fell down all around the
            top of the stairs, I stood and stared into the dark entrance, it was
            a large room inside, there where no lights so I threw out a manaball
            inside and found that there was only one thing inside the room. A
            large decagon table like structure inside, made of stone that sloped
            from the edges into the middle. On each section was a symbol,
            matching those from before, in the center was a small fist sized
            hole.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the others rested I took out my notes and copied down the
            symbol's and tried to match them to ones I already knew. There was
            four unknowns, Bone Staff, Skull Staff, two unknowns, Wing and
            another unknown. I started to look though the book for similar
            markings.
          </p>

          {/*  Xiquiripat ("Flying Scab") and Cuchumaquic ("Gathered Blood"), who sicken people's blood;
Ahalpuh ("Pus Demon") and Ahalgana ("Jaundice Demon"), who cause people's bodies to swell up;

          <h4>Volker</h4>
          <p>
            Seeing Tisiel distracted as soon as we arrive I light a manaball and
            walked around the temple, the walls where carved with scenes of
            everyday life, farmers, gold smiths, weapon makers & warriors. The
            scenes flowed one into another where on the back wall was a picture
            of the temple and a priest holding up an object on display for the
            masses blow. It suddenly felt as if cold wet eyes where looking at
            the back of my head.
          </p>

          <p>
            I infused fire into my manaball, the others stared at me but I was
            more concerned about the wet eyes that watched my actions. I
            breathed in. Turning suddenly and looking in the direction of the
            feeling, on the roof I saw another carving looking down on us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Something about the carving felt wet. It was a mess of writing of
            tendrils flopping and falling over each other with a pair of black
            eyes in the middle. They appeared to be staring at me.
          </p>

          <p>Raina - "What is it? That carving is a bit creepy."</p>

          <p>"Not sure, I felt like it was watching me."</p>

          <p>Reingard - "Sure is creepy. What is it Tisiel?"</p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Dunno yet. Their god? Not sure."</p>

          <p>
            We made camp inside the room, and waited for the sun to rise the
            next morning. We ate the rations we brought along with us non of us
            wanted to go hunting in the jungle this deep at night. I kept the
            group warm by burning the wood we had taken from the base of the
            temple. I could not sleep, not with that thing watching us.
          </p>

          <h4>Pov Otto</h4>
          <p>
            Volker could not stop glancing at the marking on the roof, after
            awhile Volker took off into the jungle while the others slept and I
            was on watch. Maybe I should of stopped him.
          </p>

          <p>
            I turned back to looking though Tisiel's notes, the same marking
            kept coming over over and over. It's one I saw in the other places
            also, first the graveyard, then the door in the cliff side and now
            here.
          </p>

          <p>"Hey Tisiel, did you find out the purpose of that room?"</p>

          <p>
            "In the cliff side? Yeah it was a tomb which was in keeping with the
            mausoleum from the grave yard, they seem to take great interest in
            death and taking their belongings with them to the grave."
          </p>

          <p>"Think this place is related to death?"</p>

          <p>
            "Yeah, but on the flip side I am hoping to get more items for
            necromancy. Did you wake me up just to ask that?"
          </p>

          <p>"You weren't asleep. Did you see Volker leave?"</p>

          <p>"What? No, where did he go?"</p>

          <p>"Into the jungle."</p>

          <p>"Should we go after him?"</p>

          <p>
            "No, I think the carving was creeping him out so he will just be
            outside."
          </p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>
          {/* need skull talking to necro girl  */}
          <p>
            I could not help but think, all of the places we found these symbols
            where related to death, each was a place someone had been laid to
            rest with their belongings but not in the same fashion, the first
            was a mausoleum similar to Heilerbach's method for buying their dead
            rulers. The second a sealed door in a cliff side, contained a spirit
            trapped into a skull, and now a Pocotcotcan style pyramid.
          </p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Hey Otto, Tisiel."</p>

          <p>"Oh hey you okay?"</p>

          <p>
            Shrorlei - "Yeah just, a door in the cliff side with a person buried
            with all his belongings is not the best description, that door
            inside the cliff side is at the back of the housing area, its deep
            within a tunnel really."
          </p>

          <p>"Yeah you're not wrong.."</p>

          <p>
            Shrorlei - "Not being picky as such just, you might be interested to
            know thats how the dwarfs burry their dead. Deep in tunnels behind
            doors or large rocks with the things they wanted to take with them."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "The Dwarfs? You don't think these are just the resting
            places of the people from our continent do you? One for each style,
            maybe just from a previous settlement of the academy that is
            forgotten about?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "No, that has holes, the strange symbols that don't match
            any writing system of our own, the strange coins, the places do have
            similarities granted but non of them are the same, the person buried
            in the cliff side was no dwarf, the king buried in the graveyard with
            necromantic items? Heilerbach's dominant religion holds the practice
            as evil."
          </p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "So do the dwarfs."</p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah, this does not line up with the mainland, but yet has
            similarities."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Tisiel, whats this symbol mean it comes up all over the
            place."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Err, yeah that one is from the previous. Hold on. Monster?
            I thought it was monster but it makes no sense for them to be
            worshiping monsters, even necromancers don't worship monsters they
            use their bodies."
          </p>

          <p>
            Volker - "Demons." Volker's voice boomed though the room and bounced
            of the walls, he strode up to the table and slammed down a dead doe.
            The blood splattered across the table from it's wounds. Volker drew
            a knife and cut the animals throat and the blood ran down the table
            to the hole and fell inside.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "What are you doing!? Now we can't read it. Where did you
            get that?"
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Demons?"</p>

          <p>Shrorlei - "Is that your offering to them?"</p>

          <p>
            Volker nodded. "Demons always want a blood sacrifice, that thing on
            the roof.." His words stopped short of explaining himself as the
            temple began to shake. Gently at first before a large violent trust,
            managing to keep balance everyone was up if Volker had not woke them
            before and the shaking suddenly stopped. To the right of the table
            where it had been floor before had slid open to reveal a passageway
            down into the darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shrorlei threw a manaball down the passageway the stairs spiraled
            down. I took a peek down and inside although it was hard to see
            where stone statue's all over. Stone warriors, Stone monsters, Stone
            wizards even a stone priest. Lastly there was a large stone king
            sitting on a stone throne. I looked to Tisiel. "A second king."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Perhaps a third? We know to little of the cliff side tomb,
            but I won't rule it out."
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard & Volker & Shrorlei made their way down the stairs,
            followed by Raina and Tisiel. I waited looking at the doe laying
            dead on the table, its blood still dripping down into the hole in
            the middle. I looked up to see the monster carved into the roof, it
            did look as if it was staring at the doe which lay on the table.
            "Enjoy the meal."
          </p>

          <p>
            I followed after the others down into the depths of the pyramid. The
            others where twisting and diving their way though the statues
            towards the king, I decided to head over to the priest to see what
            kind of clues about their religion I could find out about.
          </p>

          <p>
            The priest had a ankle length robe with many colours and patters all
            over, some of birds and trees, not skulls or anything of death
            however. He held a large pole arm with an axe head and a spear head
            combined, it was a weapon pocotcotco warriors have been recorded
            using.
          </p>

          <h4>POV Tisiel</h4>
          <p>
            Down stairs were row after row of colorful statues of warriors and
            mages monsters and animals alike, there where a few larger then
            others and some so small you could keep them on your desk as a toy.
            The king was seated on a large throne with a crown atop his head.
          </p>

          <p>
            We made a B line to the king, dodging and weaving between the stone
            people. The king was as colorful as his subjects with a crown of
            gold and many gems embedded inside. The statue's where all painted
            and although clearly made of stone the work was so well done as to
            be life like unlike the carvings which adorned the pyramid its self
            outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            The kinds hands were wrapped around the chair he sat on, at his feet
            where offerings of food, wine, gold and weapons. Unfortunately they
            where just stone recreations. The only other things of note where
            his bodyguards and a stone tablet with the strange symbols written
            across them. This time however I could see the numbers which I found
            on some of the coins Otto had given me at the start. This was a
            list, of ... something.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard had come to stand by me, I grabbed at the hem of his
            trousers. He just replied with a smile. Volker and Raina had taken
            interest in the king for awhile before looking around and marveling
            at the creatures some of which I had not even seen in books yet.
            Shrorlei had followed us at first but now she was to be found with a
            manaball in hand looking at the art on the walls. It seemed like at
            last me and Reingard had some time alone.
          </p>

          <p>"You have not forgot why we came here?"</p>

          <p>
            "No I haven't but where to start? There is nothing of value here. I
            mean nothing of value we can exchange easily, I am sure the place
            it's self is worth a small fortune to somebody."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hmm the boxes at the kings feet, it's in the book 10 for the demons
            of death and one for the lord. They might be stone but the insides
            should be what we came for."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Right." Reingard moved to open the stone chests quickly and quietly
            as the others marveled at the at the the wonders on display.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard stuff what he found into the bag at his waist and slide it
            under his cloak. As soon as he had Tisiel had finished making a
            sketch of the stone tablet they felt the pyramid shake again. A slow
            gentle rumble, building in intensity.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Time to go" I shouted, grabbing my parchments and Reingard's hard
            we ran dodging ducking diving back though the stone warriors and to
            the stairs. Volker and Raina had clearly heard me and we made to to
            the stairs together, Otto and Shrorlei were no where to be seen. I
            tugged on Reingard's hand and we climbed the stairs looking out to
            try and spot them, Shrorlei could not be seen, she was not a tall
            girl she could be behind any of these statue's. Otto was not hiding
            himself at all, he stood atop a 10m tall statue of a stag. I shouted
            to him to come quickly, but he just did not move.
          </p>

          <p>
            We waited in the room above for the other two worried the
            entranceway to the stairs would close any moment, when we had
            arrived on top the most obvious change was the doe that Volker had
            left on the stone table was gone. Not a trace was left not a single
            drop of blood. Suddenly the shaking stop. SLAM. I jumped the
            entrance way had shut tight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Volker - "I guess we should get another to open it up for them
            again.."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah, let's hunt one quickly I don't think staying inside
            there will be good." We made out way into the jungle together to
            hunt.
          </p>

          <h4>POV Shrorlei</h4>
          <p>
            I had spent my time going though the art-work on the walls when I
            felt the pyramid shake again, before I could make to to the stair
            case I saw the others move up and the lid shut. I did no panic I had
            food, water and they would open the lid again, if not though a new
            hunt then getting help from the academy. Okay maybe I was a little
            panicked.
          </p>

          <p>
            The art work had been beautiful but haunting. It had shown a war, a
            great war but not over land, food, water, precious gems but people.
            They had gone to war against other races for their people. To be
            precise the dwarves, elf's, gnoll's, gnomes and many I had never
            seen before. They took them to this temple, placed them on the
            tables and removed their hearts. It was hard to say why, or what
            they did with the hearts that was so important to them, the drawings
            just go into the creature of the stone statues around us now.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walked towards the stairs, I should wait there. On my way back I
            felt a sudden and blow to the back of my head, it felt as if my
            brain way trying to jump though the front of my skull as I fell face
            first into the ground, my nose bent on impact the blood splattered
            across the floor. I felt too much of a shock to move much at all the
            pain soon surged though me and I became overwhelmed. Reaching for my
            knife.
          </p>

          <h4>POV - Otto</h4>
          <p>
            The group of Reingard, Tisiel, Volker, Raina had come back holding
            with them some dead rabbits, sitting in the with the things they had
            left behind I smiled down at them, waiting for them to climb the
            stairs so we could pack and head home.
          </p>

          <p>"How, *pant* are you *pant* on the outside?"</p>
          <p>"It opens from the inside."</p>
          <p>"And you did not think to let Shrorlei out with you?"</p>
          <p>"Shrorlei? I thought she left first?" - Otto</p>
          <p>"We thought she was trapped in there with you." - Tisiel</p>
          <p>"Let's just open it back up" - Volker</p>

          <p>
            They had cut the rabbits on top of the table like before and spilt
            blood onto the table. While the others spent their time looking for
            Shrorlei I had opted to stay outside just incase with Tisiel. I told
            her I had found another coin around the priest and guardian sitting
            on a stone alter between them. Showing her the coin. It was similar
            to the coin in the last womans grave in weight & size. On her coin
            was a king with a skull for a face and the other a strange symbol
            like the symbols on the table upstairs. This new coin had the same
            symbol on one side and priest on the other holding a heart above a
            pyramid just like this one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon the others came up while Tisiel was checking out the new coin,
            she placed it back in my hand as the others come up with ugly faces.
            "What is wrong?" Tisiel asked quietly beside me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Shrorlei is dead. Found her with her head beaten in and mostly
            crushed, a large hold in her chest. As soon as we found her we left,
            we should tell the academy." - Volker
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "I know we are in shock, but we should move quickly. What
            ever killed her might still be in there or of been let free, there
            is nothing else we can do from here."
          </p>

          <p>
            And like that we headed back for the academy, silence filled the
            hike home.
