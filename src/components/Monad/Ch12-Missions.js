          <h3>Missions.</h3>
          <p>
            It was finally mission day, after so long of waiting first years
            where finally in a position to leave the safety of the academy and
            go into the world, both inside of the academy grounds which seem
            vast with many areas totally unexplored and the world beyond the
            portal. It was also a good way to make money.
          </p>

          <p>
            The missions where not the adventure thill ride Otto had expected,
            one of the mission slips said "Lightning mage wanted: To put
            manaballs around bathhouse to keep mosquitoes away." He had ended up
            taking this one, he had no idea what mosquitoes where but at least
            he would be helping someone. Tisiel's mission of going though old
            junk and decrypting them seemed to suit her, Reingard had even
            joined her as a bodyguard. Otto left though the portal back to
            Banderedam, this mission would take him though Chihal and down to
            Savigal a port town on the border with Huonhia. Since his ID now had
            him marked as a combat mage he was able to join a merchant group
            heading to Chihal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sitting in the back of a wagon the trip was mostly uneventful,
            Chihal sat between 3 ports so naturally had a large market place.
            There were no walls, no castle and seemed very peaceful, it was far
            from any border conflict with the monsters down south even if
            Huonhia ever tried to invade it was unlikely they would push this
            far to assault Chihal it could not serve any strategic importance.
            The town it's self was rather small, there were few farms outside
            tended by mages who had retired from the academy and inside the town
            was a few dwellings, tavern, inn and the market place. It took 9
            hours to arrive they had stopped for lunch but the time was still
            very good. It would take a further 6 hours at least to reach Savigal
            so Otto decided to book a room at the inn then have a look around
            the market place.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- Inn --> */}

          {/* <!-- Market place with strange goods. --> */}
          <p>
            The market place was selling all kind of oddities with merchants
            traveling between ports and cities stopping off here they opened
            shop from their wagons, wands, weapons, armor, skeletons, mana
            stone, mounts, there was even one merchant selling long metal tubes
            with a wooden handle, he claimed they where wands of some kind,
            their group had a hard fight against the people using them but had
            no idea how to use them himself.
          </p>
          {/* <!-- journey --> */}
          <p>
            Setting off from Chihal the weather was colder then it was
            yesterday. Without the wagon to sit in today would leave him tired.
            Wrapping the robe around himself to keep the wind off he walked
            along the path with the rainforest on either side. There were a few
            others traveling also but most of the merchants and others where
            heading to Banderedam or the two larger ports in the area. Savigal
            would be a small port it seems. After walking for 3 hours Otto
            needed to pee, walking into the rainforest just off the path to do
            it in peace.
          </p>
          {/* <!-- The dead foreigner --> */}
          <p>
            While reliving himself he soon noticed hanging above him from the
            tree was a deadman. Pulling his robe back around himself and
            grabbing his warhammer Otto span around looking about. Nothing.
            Closer inspection would show he had been dead awhile, his flesh was
            mostly gone, the eyes removed it seemed the animals had long been at
            his body, the smell was bad but thats not what had Otto's attention.
            Tangled in the vines the man was wearing strange clothes, even
            strange for a nobel, a blue jacket with gold trim, but it had no
            hood and didn't feel like a woolen robe. The cuffs and shoulders
            where not sewn into the sleeves but rather left to hand over the
            top. The mans face was strange too, but hard to judge a man who's
            been picked at by the birds. Looking down on the ground some of the
            mans belongings where here, strange purple coins, a wand that looked
            like the merchants wands back in Chihal, the one that did not know
            how they worked. There where papers and food. Otto decided to move
            the items into his bag as the mans bag was torn.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'll take them back to the academy with me maybe Tisiel can make
            sense of these things." setting back on the path to Savigal Otto
            made his way for another hour before coming across another body, a
            merchant he had seen earlier that day. This body was fresh, still
            bleeding out but long dead. He was not a well to do merchant, he had
            no wagon or body guards but was traveling with others. Seems they
            had no robbed him as his trinkets and food lay scattered about the
            path and into the forest.
          </p>
          {/* <!-- Danger --> */}

          <p>
            Getting closer to the body Otto could see the dead body of a large
            wolf in the direction the blood went into the forest, the wolf was
            almost 2 meters tall when stood on all fours and over 3 meters long.
            The problem was there was only one wolf body, even Otto knew wolves
            don't attack alone normally. The other merchants where no where to
            be seen, perhaps the pack is still chasing them? They might double
            back for the kill they got, I should get away from here.
          </p>

          <p>
            I left at a brisk pace down the road, since the merchants didn't
            come back towards me I must assume they made their way down here so
            I should keep a look out. Soon enough I came across the other
            merchants, arranged around the wagon with small gaps in their line.
            Unable to see into the forest the only monsters I could make out
            where two large wolves similar size to the one back with the dead
            merchant and one smaller about half their size closest to my
            position. Unsure of what to do for awhile I just stayed still, soon
            enough a large man in the group shouted towards me. "If you stand
            alone they will target you and take you out, run quick and get into
            the group." at his shout I ran, I ran as fast as I could, not having
            invested many points into dexterity it was not easy as I used the
            strength I had invested into my stats to pump my legs as hard as I
            could. Soon enough the wolves noticed me, the small one charged
            towards me as the merchant's and body guards intercepted the larger
            wolves taking this opportunity to attack them. Seeing the wolf run
            towards me with its fangs out scared me. I gripped tight around the
            warhammer and launched myself with Charged Charge, my legs twitched
            with lighting, my speed shot up over that 1 meter gap. Launching
            myself warhammer first into the beast it hit the ground with a
            whimper, blood and fangs splattered over the floor. The hammer has
            caused more damage then the lighting. A normal baby wolf would of
            had it's whole head caved in, my attack did 72%. The large man who
            had called me over stabbed a spear into the wolf as it tried to get
            back up. It would never get back up.
          </p>

          <p>
            He ran to help with the two larger wolves, I tried to strike one of
            them with a lightning strike, 0.05% damage. One of the larger wolves
            was slayed the other ran bleeding back into the forest. I was later
            told by Giselher the large body guard who speared the smaller wolf
            that the large wolves where between level 20 and 29. They had high
            magic defences and often made pray of magical or weak humans. I
            don't know what the large wolf dropped by the small wolf dropped a
            pair of gloves, Giselher gave them to me saying I did most of the
            damage anyway and he was surprised a mage would have so much
            strength. I gladly accepted it would be my first monster drop. To
            get to Savigal I decided to join their group just encase the last
            wolf made a return.
