new game / on going game / world jump - no sure yet
node system -
magic, stats, skills, items

fire ball at 1:1, then at 2:1 - intensity
2:2 - area of effect
2:3 cost of skill
etc.
So you have branching paths to take to make the skill customized.
Key nodes at 1, 3?, 6, 9, 10
Items, same thing but more crafted on. Little rng.
stats, A tree of stats. So you can focus towards something like dex stacking but maybe a little of the other stats thrown in, depends on Species/class.

Skills have a tree,
Items have Trees
Class has tree?
Species tree = stats

Triangles mark an alternative node. so a node that gives reduced mana cost now gives increased mana cost, or what was once increased projectile speed might turn into increased number of projectiles.

Square represents a mana expansion of a node, the node itself, and any nodes within its radius designated give no bonuses but all other nodes within the radius give their bonuses instead

Circle, expanded node, inject 1 point into the node to expand it and move up to 2 nodes away. If the node is a major node then move up to 3 nodes away.

Otto - 1
He was the youngest of 11, and the first to stay in this world longer than a few moments.

His siblings lay at the back of the house, 11 small graves. Although we never stopped trying, secretly, we both feel he was a miracle we cannot re-create.

Otto -2
I have memories, or, visions, just childish fantasies or ideas perhaps. I feel like this body is not fully my own, but I am a puppeteer pulling it's strings. I cannot put it into words, nothing I can place my finger or feels out of place. Just a feeling my soul does not match this world.

Otto -3
Only natives of this world can receive the blessings of this world while your body is strengthened your soul is not.

Otto part 2 /
True Aldenese, as they say, are blonde with blue eyes. Untainted, pure. Most Aldenese to me seem to be brunettes with brown eyes like myself. We are all born here, as were our parents. If that does not make us Aldenese, are those born in the West with blonde hair and blue eyes more so than us?

It is not like the royals, sorry the not-at-all-royal dukes who pinky promise they won't rule us as kings did, have blue eyes. They famously have purple eyes. Eyes of royalty, or divine providence as they call it today. Then again it would come as no surprise to hear a prince say he was not Aldenese but Uber-Aldenese.

Perhaps we would all think the same if everyone we met kissed the ground we walked too, from the moment we were born.

Re-Write all early story to have 1 - 9 being mage, no element and at level 10 you find out your element so they can change class like the rogue and fighter. Chapter 13 and earlier.

The flicker fusion threshold, Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) or flicker fusion rate, is a concept in the psychophysics of vision. It is defined as the frequency at which an intermittent light stimulus appears to be completely steady to the average human observer.

# Random Ideas:

As Elemental resistance moves into absorbtion it reduces your other elemental resistances so you cannot be immune to fire and ice for example..

The reason for cool downs (CD) is the route which the mana travels, (practiced, made, trained) in your body is "toast" for a moment. Be that 1 second or 1 day. Could you provide less mana and maintain the effect longer? There should be a minimum requirement to initiate the skill, so that would be by improving on the skill you are finding ways to lower is initial cost but keep the same performance. Training those pathways. Are they physical pathways? Would it not be better to say they are the routes which mana travels for that skill/spell not an actual hole in your body. Moving mana from the inside to the outside of the body should take longer to learn then moving around inside one's self, but magic is about moving the mana already outside of the body most of the time.

magic is about magically making use of the mana around you, easier if the mana is closer to you. Fighting is about making using of the mana from within yourself. Inquisitor's for example make use of both, even so far as using the internal mana, forcing out out into the external world as lightning. A mixture of both methods.

Rouges are making using of beasts innate memories to learn their "pathways"

A regiment made of slacking nobles who bribed their way in that would be hard to command around in war time.

Monster is something to fear, the powerful animals found around the world are 'beasts'

Dad asks boy for reason to become stronger

Change the first monster into a russian woodlands monster

Each person has a sin
Otto - Wrath
Tisiel = Power
Ibn Battuta - Legendary quest.

first is wrath. Wrath and rage are generally a response to when you feel your power is being taken or trespassed upon. This emotion allowed you to sacrifice intellect for strength to regain that power. This is not a healthy way to do it obviously but it is instinctual and it is a deadly sin because its so very self destructive. It is also one of two sins that are self fueling.

The most obvious is pride. Or ego. It is common for the arrogant or the egotist to believe they alone are worthy of more power. And since others are of no value to ego it means nothing to step on someone else to attain that power.

Another is greed. The all consuming thirst for more. It doesn't matter if its owned by another, if it has nothing to do with you. Greed wants it all. Wealth, fame, women, men, objects, power, godhood. All of these things are to be taken by those who blindly live greed.

An obscure one is envy. The fear of not being as good as another in some capacity. The fastest way to overcome your insecurities, to become more powerful than others.

And even lust. The singular obsession. It doesn't matter what is lusted after if it becomes your obsession it is lust. Whether it be sexual or something else, lust is simply pure obsession. The lust for power is often the strongest form of lust.

Vampire healing, Healing spells that can heal people or debuff. Giving the healers options to attack. Heals that deal a set amount of healing to a group, targeting the lowest HP first.

Calculations:
At higher levels it should take longer, since you have access to more skills you want to use. Rather then looking at the damage output it should be how many moves more can someone take.

function Damage3 (ATK, DEF, LVL1, LVL2) {
const Power = (ATK + ((ATK + LVL1)/32) _ ((ATK _ LVL1)/32))_0.5
console.log((Power))
const Defense = (DEF + ((DEF + LVL2)/32) _ ((DEF * LVL2)/32))*0.25
console.log(Defense)
let Answer = ((Power+(Power/100 * Math.random()*3)) - (Defense+(Defense/100 * Math.random()*3)))/(LVL2*DEF/(10*LVL1))
if (Answer > 0) return Answer
return 1
}

NPC
You level up for the first time and your class is picked.
You find out which element you are most suited to at level 10 (Can pick).

USER
You pick a basic class and become level 1.
level 1 - 9 is the tutorial period.
You pick an element at level 10.
At this point you can use teleport stations, and travel to cities.

// Vampire type, more blood taken makes them stronger so often conflict with humans
// Vampire type, more hunger makes them stronger so often hide from humans
// The people coming off the boats don't have to be human
// Merging the stats into a few, Vitality, magic, strength, sense, charm

Pokemon Style Elements battles!
// Obsidian is the royals resource - Obsidian is hard, brittle, and amorphous; it therefore fractures with sharp edges. In the past, it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools, and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.
He's so sorry his mamma swapped him for a dog. And then drowned the dog.

// kick in the balls - level 9: A kick, that causes the the life of those yet to be, to flash through the mind of the person on the receiving end.

// Otto starts of young, at fault of his birth status, unable to make use of the gifts given. Grows from the mentors lessons and overcomes the birth status.

// The villain overall is the sea people, but the villain of Alden arc should be a noble who comes earlier in the story then intended to set up a level of respect, power and intelligence. The sea people is a overarching strange treat to the people of Monad. - Alphonse

// The villains are defeated near the start, then enslaved so its hard to see them as a threat, that is how they are treated by the natives also. But the treat comes later once they establish themselves. This will be hard to write.

// Otto becomes the villain for the Aldenese later (Well a Thief) but the hero of Niyosho but to start with is another villain of Niyosho as he is a foreigner. Maybe these chapters would be better from another's view point.

// Alden / elves are the villain for the other countries. Until they are not, replaced by something worse, the sea peoples empire.

# Notes:

## Game

24 hour or what ever timers / quests / daily's didn't just sit there making players have to come back everyday to no content.
They stacked up and when you came back after 3 days you got 3 charges. Etc. Nicer for players who have to work.
Smart contracts

### PVP

Add LoL style PVP mode , other content is needed in end games.
Guilds fighting over castles and towns
World bosses trigger pvp mode for all? So you have to fight off gankers

### Horizontal Content

Roulette - good idea from ff14, daily bonus, and helps lower players get matches
Everything you can do in real life can be done in the safe zones, this is the biggest income for the game, out weighing the other games content by player count by over 90%.

Hidden bosses, clues, working together,

The pvp effects the PVE, the costs of doing anything by taxes etc, are you friends with this guild or neutral.
The pve effecting the pvp, getting items and equipment to fuel the pvp or monsters changing the landscape
World bosses that need multiple Guilds (NON PVP & PVP modes)

### Tiers / Ranks:

Junk (Grey) / Common(Light grey) / Basic (Blue) / intermediate(Light blue)/ Advanced(Cyan) / Rare (Green) / Epic (Red) / Legendary (Orange) / Unique (Purple) / God (Gold)

Basic, Intermediate, Advanced.

The classes and species could be catabolized into tiers [1, 2, 3] or ranks [bronze, silver, gold], [junk, common, normal, intermediate, advanced rare, elite, epic, legendary, unique]

E D C B A S

junk, common, normal, intermediate, advanced rare, elite, epic, legendary, Heavenly, Divine, Mythic, Celestial 

team bonus for fighter/rogue/mage

<li>Classes/Species</li>
Blue - 0 - 50 +2, 51 - 100 + 3
Green - 0 - 50 + 3, 51 - 100 +2
Red - 0-50 +3, 51 - 100 +3
Orange - 0-50 + 4, 51 - 100 +3

### Guilds

Should guilds get buffs during non guild activities? I think not.

#### Things guilds can do

- Stables for mounts
- Guild residence
- Guild quests
- Guild wars
- Towns / Cities
- Guild storage
- Contribution points
- Private room
- Guild battle flag
- Guild emblem
- Flying ships / Subs
- War tanks
- Guardians (for the guild, think the guards around the vampires in skyrim.)
- Building their own castle? Maybe the residence just changes into that in the end.
- Mines
- Auction house
- Ship yard
- Wizard tower
- Training towers / squares

#### Types of guilds

    - PVE
    - PVP
    - Traders
    - Crafters
    - Corporate
    - Friends
    - Roleplayers

### Parties & Raids

Half party / Light party = 4
Party / Full party = 8
Full Raid or Alliance = 3 parties or 24 players
After that you can do the Army size of 50, 100 +

### Death

The stronger the place you die, the worse the penalty. However not all deaths are equal.
Reasons for death, Story, PVP, PVE, Traps, Dialog.

Exp debt - Fun idea, you have to earn that much exp before your bar goes back to normal.
Skill loss - Like how? Points loss? OR like you become less proficient?
permadeath - Hell no.
Corpse runs, full loot drop. Runescape style. Not a personal fan of this.
Single / Many item drops. I'm okay with this.
Debuffs - I love it. They should not last forever, or be curable if they do. Make the user go out of their way as a punishment.
Repairs - Great money sink.
Time out - Yeah, just not all the time. Maybe special cases.
http://wiki.projectgorgon.com/wiki/Website_Death_Penalties_Explained - Fun
Death can be fun, something like the curses shown here.

### Monsters / Beasts

Difficulty [normal]. Everyone above level 10 will be synced down to
level 10. It is someone's first time in the dungeon, therefore all
drop rates are increased by 20%, also death penalties are reduced by
10%."

### Items

All useable items can have a Durability, giving them a need to be repaired, if possible.
Item need vs greed. can only need on your own class.
Items that grow with you for a period of time, I.e. Level 0 - 10 sword. Level 50 - 90 staff. Something like that.

Coins - 1 gold - around 1000 or 30 days of work ?
Mana Coins

Tonbogiri – One of three legendary spears created by the famed swordsmith Muramasa. It is said to be so sharp that a dragonfly landing on the edge would be instantly cut in half. This is the origin of the name.

### Skills/Spells

Mastery over skills, so the skills level up? Costs points / experience.

Tree:
You gain a node every 5 levels. For a total of 20 nodes.
Skills are unlocked and added to the node to be used. The skill in the node can be leveled up 10 times.
Passive's + Skills related to the skill branch off from this skill, creating links between them.

E.g.
=> Faster casting
Fireball => Meteor => Increased AOE range
=> Increased AOE range
=> Increased fire damage

So fire ball is connected to meteor, but both are connected to increased AOE range so they create a double connection.

The enemy may have the Moon People on their side, but we have lovely hats! And those hats will protect us from their fearsome gaze! (If your general has the “mad” trait)

Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset because the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old lands but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal.

### Eras/History:

{/_ Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, (Huge beats, men struggling, the island is cleansed of men), (Foundation of empires in the east and this continent is invaded by the humans for the first time since the immortals), (Men overcome beasts and empires start here and in the east the religious wars start), Pyramid (Kʼawiil) Empires of men, Pocotcotcan (The one empire), Witch (Rebellion), Now. _/}
{/_ Pre-Dao, Dao, Immortal, Dark-Age, (Dawn Age) Great Migration, Warning Kingdoms Period, Pyramid (The One Kingdom), Pocotcotcan Empire, Witch, Now. _/}

Blood tax, one child from 40 house holds. (Ottomans)

It has been at least 107 years since the fall of Pocotcotco as an empire.
The Elves and the republic have had at least 2 famous battles against each other.

The new world is in a balance.
The Republic fractures from invasions by the Elves, late empire problems, uninterested ruling class, Alden invasion, Sea people sabotage.
Alden invades Herkikia League, they both collapse under the sea peoples invasion.
The Kingdom having become the Empire forms a deal with Niyosho but are both destroyed by the sea people
Our characters flee through the desert/Solzi into Pocotcotco, who are under invasion by the Elves.
Who again fall before the sea people in ruin.

Miasma, "a contagious power... that has an independent life of its own. Until purged by the sacrificial death of the wrongdoer, society would be chronically infected by catastrophe".

According to the Popl Vuh, Mitnal was a dark land flowing with rivers of blood and pus and populated by deities with names such as Bloody Teeth, Bloody Claws, and Flying Scab, among others.

Dragon of the desert ate all the elephants on this land.
