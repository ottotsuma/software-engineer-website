Re-Write all early story to have 1 - 9 being mage, no element and at level 10 you find out your element so they can change class like the rouge and fighter. Chapter 13 and earlier.
# Random Ideas:

Strength[2]	Strength increases Physical Attack Power and the weight behind each attack.
Agility[3]	Agility increases Attack Speed and Movement Speed.
Endurance[4]	Endurance increases maximum HP and stamina.
Inteligence[5]	Intelligence increases Magical Attack Power and maximum MP.
Vitality[6]	Vitality increases the recovery rate of MP and HP.

Quest - hell or high water
Pigeons without wings - attacking ?

NPC
You level up for the first time and your class is picked.
You find out which element you are most suited to at level 10 (Can pick).

USER
You pick a basic class and become level 1. 
level 1 - 9 is the tutorial period.
You pick an element at level 10. 
At this point you can use teleport stations, and travel to cities.

// Vampire type, more blood taken makes them stronger so often conflict with humans
// Vampire type, more hunger makes them stronger so often hide from humans
// The people coming off the boats don't have to be human
// Merging the stats into a few, Vitality, magic, strength, sense, charm


# To do:
Pokemon Style Elements battles!
// Obsidian is the royals resource - Obsidian is hard, brittle, and amorphous; it therefore fractures with sharp edges. In the past, it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools, and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.
He's so sorry his mamma swapped him for a dog. And then drowned the dog.

// kick in the balls - level 9: A kick, that causes the the life of those yet to be, to flash though the mind of the person on the receiving end.

// Otto starts of young, at fault of his birth status, unable to make use of the gifts given. Grows from the mentors lessons and overcomes the birth status. 

// The villain overall is the sea people, but the villain of Alden arc should be a noble who comes earlier in the story then intended to set up a level of respect, power and intelligence. The sea people is a overarching strange treat to the people of Monad. - Alphonse

// The villains are defeated near the start, then enslaved so its hard to see them as a threat, that is how they are treated by the natives also. But the treat comes later once they establish themselves. This will be hard to write.

// Otto becomes the villain for the Aldenese later (Well a Thief) but the hero of leika but to start with is another villain of leika as he is a foreigner. Maybe these chapters would be better from another's view point.

// Alden / elves are the villain for the other countries. Until they are not, replaced by something worse, the sea peoples empire.

// Water Pure (defence) , natural (healing) , dirty (poison)

# Notes:

### Example below:

https://github.com/ottotsuma/ottotsuma.github.io/blob/master/images/goblin.jpg?raw=true

import React from "react";
import { Content } from "./styles"
function Intro(props) {
return (
<Content>
</Content>
);
}
export default Intro;

## Game

24 hour or what ever timers / quests / daily's didn't just sit there making players have to come back everyday to no content.
They stacked up and when you came back after 3 days you got 3 charges. Etc. Nicer for players who have to work.
Smart contracts 
### PVP
Add LoL style PVP mode , other content is needed in end games.
Guilds fighting over castles and towns 
World bosses trigger pvp mode for all? So you have to fight off gankers 

### Horizontal Content
Roulette - good idea from ff14, daily bonus, and helps lower players get matches
Everything you can do in real life can be done in the safe zones, this is the biggest income for the game, out weighing the other games content by player count by over 90%.

Hidden bosses, clues, working together,

The pvp effects the PVE, the costs of doing anything by taxes etc, are you friends with this guild or neutral.
The pve effecting the pvp, getting items and equipment to fuel the pvp or monsters changing the landscape 
World bosses that need multiple Guilds (NON PVP & PVP modes)
 

### Tiers / Ranks:

Junk (Grey) / Common(Light grey) / Basic (Blue) / intermediate(Light blue)/ Advanced(Cyan) / Rare (Green) / Epic (Red) / Legendary (Orange) / Unique (Purple) / God (Gold)


Basic, Intermediate, Advanced.

The classes and races could be catabolized into tiers [1, 2, 3] or ranks [bronze, silver, gold], [junk, common, normal, intermediate, advanced rare, elite, epic, legendary, unique]

E D C B A S

team bonus for fighter/rogue/mage

<li>Classes/Races</li>

Red - 0-50 +3, 51 - 100 +3
Orange - 0-50 + 4, 51 - 100 +3

### Guilds
Should guilds get buffs during non guild activities? I think not.
#### Things guilds can do
 - Stables for mounts
 - Guild residence
 - Guild quests
 - Guild wars
 - Towns / Cities
 - Guild storage
 - Contribution points
 - Private room
 - Guild battle flag
 - Guild emblem
 - Flying ships / Subs
 - War tanks
 - Guardians (for the guild, think the guards around the vampires in skyrim.)
 - Building their own castle? Maybe the residence just changes into that in the end.
 - Mines
 - Auction house
 - Ship yard
 - Wizard tower
 - Training towers / squares 

#### Types of guilds
    - PVE
    - PVP
    - Traders
    - Crafters
    - Corporate
    - Friends
    - Roleplayers

### Parties & Raids
Half party / Light party = 4 
Party / Full party = 8 
Full Raid or Alliance = 3 parties or 24 players
After that you can do the Army size of 50, 100 + 


### Death 
The stronger the place you die, the worse the penalty. However not all deaths are equal.
Reasons for death, Story, PVP, PVE, Traps, Dialog.

Exp lose - simple.
Exp debt - Fun idea, you have to earn that much exp before your bar goes back to normal.
Skill loss - Like how? Points loss? OR like you become less proficient? 
permadeath - Hell no.
Corpse runs, full loot drop. Runescape style. Not a personal fan of this.
Single / Many item drops. I'm okay with this.
Debuffs - I love it. They should not last forever, or be curable if they do. Make the user go out of their way as a punishment.
Repairs - Great money sink.
Time out - Yeah, just not all the time. Maybe special cases.
http://wiki.projectgorgon.com/wiki/Website_Death_Penalties_Explained - Fun
Death can be fun, something like the curses shown here.

### Monsters
Driver ants https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnooyOZRzkM - Blind large ants with pincers, swarming anything they come into contact with until one side is dead.

Sea Star zombies - Limbs detaching and living their own life for a period of time. The main body can regrow the limbs.

### Items
All useable items can have a Durability, giving them a need to be repaired, if possible.
Item need vs greed. can only need on your own class.
Items that grow with you for a period of time, I.e. Level 0 - 10 sword. Level 50 - 90 staff. Something like that.

Tsuma was on a quest to learn the german magic and to acquire a new class by combining the class of her lands with the new one.

empire emperor dies and the mother fights back against the sons reforms, the reforms chose one religion and code of ethics to rule by instating new schools and imperial examinations, the court fight back and the new emperor puts his pawns in low level positions though-out the court so he can control it in secret when his mother dies he pacifies the lower realms

during the war monsters get past and kill villagers from Otto's village his parents included and the blame is placed on otto and his forces but in was in fact the young lords

### Speeches:

Using total war general speeches for the speeches

"By the gods, how dare these peasants dare raise a hand in rebellion? How dare they? What were they thinking, if anything? Were they bored with buggering goats? Well, we'll kill them, and make the goats feel safer."

The enemy may have the Moon People on their side, but we have lovely hats! And those hats will protect us from their fearsome gaze! (If your general has the “mad” trait)

## Physical World
### Monsters
undead hags, water hags, blood corpse, flies, 
### Countries:

Granduchy - elected grand duke from dukes.
principality - ruled by a prince 
kingdom - king
republic - representatives from each place - all elected also
Places joined together though alliance? to act as one unit under one representative
pocotcotco ?
chalbia ?

Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset because the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old lands but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal.

### Eras/History:

{/* Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, (Huge beats, men struggling, the island is cleansed of men), (Foundation of empires in the east and this continent is invaded by the humans for the first time since the immortals), (Men overcome beasts and empires start here and in the east the religious wars start), Pyramid (Kʼawiil) Empires of men, Pocotocotcan (The one empire), Witch (Rebellion), Now. */}
{/* Pre-Dao, Dao, Immortal, Dark-Age, (Dawn Age) Great Migration, Warning Kingdoms Period, Pyramid (The One Kingdom), Pocotocotcan Empire, Witch, Now. */}

Blood tax, one child from 40 house holds. (Ottomans)

It has been at least 107 years since the fall of Pocotcotco as an empire.
The Elves and the republic have had at least 2 famous battles against each other.

The new world is in a balance. 
The Republic fractures from invasions by the Elves, late empire problems, uninterested ruling class, Alden invasion, Sea people sabotage.
Alden invades Huonhia, they both collapse under the sea peoples invasion.
The Kingdom having become the Empire forms a deal with Leika but are both destroyed by the sea people
Our characters flee though the desert/Chalbia into Pocotcotco, who are under invasion by the Elves.
Who again fall before the sea people in ruin.
