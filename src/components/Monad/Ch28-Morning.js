          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            I woke in a soft bed, my arm felt like the blood has been drained
            from it so I pulled it back towards me and along with it came Tsuma.
            Can't complain. So I just led in the bed awhile longer the sun
            slowly creeping up the bed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few hours later I was back in class. I had magic class with Lubin
            in the morning for one hour, a break and then lightning classes for
            one hour. After that we where suppose to be in our club activities
            until lunch. After lunch was our normal training. Today being the
            first day since my class had changed from Mage to KÊ¼awiil I found
            there where a few small problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a start the magic classes where about the Mage class. The only
            parts of the lecture I could use where bits on the human race skills
            which was in the past the least relevant as I wanted to be a combat
            mage and not really the party leader. Also the lessons about mana
            and magic in a more general sense. I could only hope to get though
            any practical parts of the lessons by using the stress of just
            coming back as a reason why I could no longer cast manaball. Not
            sure how long I could keep this up for. Lubin ended the lesson by
            saying. "Next class we are looking at the stun skill, this is really
            useful for those of you looking to join the military, security
            forces, honestly since it is non-lethal it is a really useful skill.
            I would recommend you to get it but I will not force you I know some
            of you have your own family builds etc. See you next class."
          </p>
          {/* Lubin not the lighting teacher, so maybe he cannot look at this skill by touch skills in general? */}
          <p>
            I thought at first at least I had a lightning element class, so the
            lightning lessons would still be useful to me. That was true, the
            lessons where very helpful in understanding the lightning elemental
            and how to control it. It's just my spells list had changed, I did
            not have the spells they where speaking about. The color of my
            lightning had changed also, very visibly so. On top of that I had to
            use the same act from earlier this morning as a reason why I could
            no longer produce lightning spells I could use only before hand.
          </p>

          <p>I was going to get caught out at some point.</p>

          <p>
            I was suppose to go to a club until lunch time, I wrote down that I
            would join the martialist club. I assume I could get away with
            missing one week, or changing clubs. After all I had just been set
            back to level one, if I went like this it would be too obvious, even
            if I kept up my on physical body to its peak I would fall behind
            those with stat points in dexterity, strength and vitality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to head straight for the canteen, I would use my lunch
            token to get my lunch now and then take it over to the training
            areas. They keep monsters near the arena for testing students, there
            must be a way for me to register to fight some of them. I grabbed
            bead, a sausage and some cheese for my lunch, then headed to the
            arena area.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wondered around the arena, once I got near area they kept monsters
            in a man stopped me at the door. "Students are suppose to be doing
            clubs now, I think you are lost. Only teachers can come inside here
            anyway, it's full of monsters." The man said. I quickly apologized
            and told him I must of gotten lost and walked away. There goes my
            master plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walked pasted the strength testing area and decided to check out
            my ranking, there where some people gathered around it. They where
            from a body building club. I told them I was just walking past and
            wanted to check my ranking on the board quickly, they become more
            interested in me until while looking for my name on the rankings, I
            could not find it. I don't understand I was rank 4th for this years
            students, yes only the top 100 where on display unless you searched
            with your mana inside of the pillar but how could I of lost my place
            already? I scanned the pillar to find my new ranking, but it told
            me. "User is not found."
          </p>

          <p>
            Was it because my class had changed also? My mana had changed? The
            body builders tried to console me, saying if I keep trying I can get
            back in to the top 100 again! I could only thank that they
            misunderstood my reaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I could leave they insisted on showing me how they train so
            that I could become stronger in the future. I was expecting them to
            be lifting weights like some of the military I had seen in the past.
            There was a boy on the ground doing an impersonation of an ape,
            hitting his fists into the floor, on his chest and then into a
            strength testing device. 20!? "What level is this guy?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "15, it's a human perk. Ape Mode, increases strength damage with
            bare fists for a period of time, while decreasing your defenses." A
            student replied. These people where mad. I walked off while they
            were watching him.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was lost. I couldn't easily kill the monsters brought into the
            arena because I was a student. I could leave the academy, but
            getting permission now would be impossible since Lubin thinks I am
            unable to cast spells right now. Can't believe I just spend my time
            watching a boy pretend to be an ape.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked off not really with any place in mind. I started to think
            about what kind of club I really did want to join anyway, we could
            always move around and switch clubs if the new club would accept us.
            My magic was now strange and did not match everyone else, all of my
            stat points had reset so I was a blank slate again. It's not unheard
            of, people who join great families or the military have had
            resources given to them to change their element, or even their whole
            class. This was different however, because if I admitted I was level
            1, it would be the same as admitting I found a new class in the
            tomb. Who knows what they would do to me then.
          </p>
          {/* People: Vasso, Ralsan (Farming), Linhart(ASS), Volker & Raina (Arena), Tsuma */}
          <p>
            "Yo, Omen Otto!" A boy shouted from up one of the streets as I was
            walking away from the arena. Omen Otto? Did I have a nickname like
            that? I turned to see who it was. Maybe they were talking to some
            one else. It was Ralsan, from the cliffs. I was told he moved out
            because the cliffs was being shut down, I never really saw much of
            him before because he was training to become a farmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey Ralsan. Omen Otto? Is that my nick name?" I asked a little
            confused as Ralsan got closer to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, I came up with it myself! Since you know, everyone from the
            cliff side that went out with you either ended up dead or missing.
            Thought it might lighten the mood." He said with a huge smile on his
            face.
          </p>
          <p>"You sure are odd Ralsan." I said confused.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah I get that a lot. I think it is all the time I spend under the
            sun. Never really see other people much these days. What you doing
            right now? Not joined a club yet?" He asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well I joined the martialist club, but really I want to switch. I
            am not sure what to join though nothing really suits me." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Why don't you try farming? It's what I do. Well I do it as a
            fulltime course but I mean there is a farming club also for those
            who want to do it on the side. I just joined the farming club to
            help the members there. I am going that way now if you want to try!"
            Ralsan said excitedly, maybe he really likes farming.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah I guess I was just looking for a new club but .... Farming was
            not what I had in mind...." I thought the only spell I had right now
            was lighting seeds. While it had the word 'seeds' in the name I
            think that was because of the look of the spell not really that it
            was related to farming...
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah come on, you can't walk around aimlessly you will be caught by
            an enforcer at some point, come join just for the day!" Ralsan said
            with a cheer.
          </p>
          <p>"Enforcer?" I asked puzzled.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, do you fall asleep in class or something? 2nd years and some
            other older students and teachers are appointed enforcers. If they
            catch students not doing their assigned classes there can be
            punishments." He said as if it was obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess he has a point, no other students where like me just
            wondering around... "Okay, I'll try for a day!" I said, I mean a day
            can't hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked with Ralsan to the gate he was walking to. Unlike the gates
            I passed though when heading to the tomb this one was much smaller,
            there was only two guards and the sign above the gate said. "Farmers
            only".
          </p>
          <p>
            "This gate just leads to the farms, so only the farmers can come out
            this way. It's the same side as the cliffs if you look at the
            academy from above. Past here is nothing dangerous so even with your
            bad luck we will be fine." Ralsan joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could not get over how happy go lucky he was. Maybe he was right,
            the sun had damaged his brain. I felt like being in the darkness had
            got to me personally. Maybe this will even things out.
          </p>
          <p>
            From that point until lunch time he had worked me to the point of
            death. We had to move crate loads of seeds, from a warehouse to the
            farms where the students would use their earth abilities to prepare
            the land, wind magic to distribute the seeds and water magic to
            water the seeds. While every step of the way used magic or a method
            to make it easier, that did not mean that it was easy. Since I had a
            lightning ability at first they thought I might be able to help with
            some things, but every spell they asked if I had I had to say I did
            not...
          </p>
          <p>
            When it was finally lunch time I sat down with Ralsan who kept
            talking about all the work that still had to be done, what progress
            they had made, what was been grown and research into new plants and
            fruits. I ate the lunch I had got this morning but Ralsan had given
            me another. Perk of working on the farms I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked though my spells list while Ralsan was talking to me.
            Surprised that I had more then one spell with the word 'Seed' inside
            the description. I could only see the basic level spells because my
            level was too low. Apart from lightning seeds, there was also:
            Lightning germination, Seeds to soldiers, Lightning growth,
            Lightning harvest.
          </p>
          <p>
            What shocked me more when I finally looked though the descriptions
            was the strange things they did. KÊ¼awiil might have lighting powers
            but was not limited to that like a mage. There where skills and
            spells for snakes, farming, fertility and even a spell for a
            specific plant called cacao.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hey Ralsan, I do have some spells that might be able to help out
            with farming... I am not sure if I should get them or not but I
            would need to level up, im quite close really." I said hoping there
            might be pests that come here since it is a farm. Maybe I could kill
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Eh really? So you'll stay? It is fun right? Once you get started
            you just can't stop there is always something that needs doing. If
            you say they are useful for farming you must of been thinking about
            staying right? You know since you don't really have any useful
            spells the afternoon might be hard for you..." He said at a speed
            that almost blew my ears off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, that is what I was thinking. So maybe I could work as like
            pest control for now?" I asked hoping to get more to what I really
            wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh yeah! That's a good idea. Since you are thinking about joining
            the club it would be useful for us both. I will go ask, usually the
            pest control jobs are filled up pretty quick because it is easy
            experience but there might be bigger pests or something..." His
            words tailed off as he ran away from me over to where the older
            students where eating lunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            He came running back a few minutes later. "Good news! They don't
            mind giving the western fields to you, while it won't be a lot of
            experience or anything big there are birds and rodents that come to
            steal the seeds after they are planted. If you go now there might be
            some since we are all here eating." Ralsan said. Not waiting any
            longer I stood up and thanked him as much as I could while running
            off though the fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had run though the fields until I found birds pecking at the
            ground. It was not long before I came across a three-legged crow.
            Some people say they represent the sun, I say they represent one
            exp! I shot my lighting seed at it and it landed on the crows wing.
            At first the crow was shocked, literally. But shortly after he flew
            up into the air! I was so weak I could not even one shot a crow! I
            guess it is really a spell to regenerate mana rather then pure
            killing but still...
          </p>
          <p>
            While I stood there in my frustration I failed the notice the crow
            turn towards me and attempt a dive bomb into me. Flying downwards at
            great speed with its beak ready to pierce me. I jumped out the way
            at the last moment, <Shine>*Ping*</Shine>, exp + 1. The crow had died mid flight
            and then crashed into the ground. At least it's body will help the
            seeds grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I kept finding three-legged crows and shotting lighting seeds at
            them taking care to run away after. I noticed sometimes I missed my
            target with the lightning seeds so I guess the accuracy of this
            spell is like lightning-ball, it sometimes just goes off target. I
            am sure it won't hurt the seeds in the ground, it is a seed. Kind
            of.
          </p>
          <p>
            One exp is not much, but they slowly added up. This is maybe why
            they gave me these fields. Even at level ten, one exp is nothing.
            However I was just a level one so it would all add up. The afternoon
            went quickly for me and I was able to find more then three-legged
            crows at the edges of the fields. Nests of exploding forest rats,
            cute at first, harmless mostly, all they do is steal seeds from the
            fields. However once you kill one they explode on their death. This
            was great if you could sneak up on them and kill them near the other
            ones, however they had great senses and rushed any intruder that
            came close not stopping until one of you was dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            This behavior worked well for me, I would just put seeds along the
            edges of the field and when they came to get seeds from the field
            they would be shocked, go into a fighting squeal and call all their
            friends, who promptly blew each other up fighting the lightning
            seed. How are they not extinct?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a shame that an assisted kill only netted half as much
            experience. Still far less dangerous then fighting them head on. I
            started clearing out all the nests along the edges, once no more of
            them would come out of a nest I would shoot a seed inside and get
            more experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to join the farming club, it turned out to be a nice safe
            way to get low level experience. Classes where a pain as each time I
            would have to say I was not ready to join in yet. Lubin had seen me
            after class twice already to check up on me and make reports back to
            Lenne. After 3 weeks I thought they might of realised something was
            wrong but when they asked about the farming club I said it was going
            really well and I was enjoying Lubin made it a point that I could
            always drop out of combat classes and take a non-combat role if the
            experience had me unable to cast spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            I genuinely considered it, I had strange farming spells that would
            put me in a specialty. I also had the inspect skill so
            I could check the durability of all the tools that needed to be
            used. Then I would go back to killing pests.
          </p>
          <LevelUp

      />
          <p>
            I had reached level 2 a while ago, I just never told anyone hoping to get more
            experience. After reaching level 5 the exp gained from the pests had seriously dropped and I became bored.

            I had way more spell points to spend then even when I was level 14
            before, but the stat points remained the same. Increasing my magic was obvious choice every level. It
            increased the power of my lighting seeds, but what to do with the
            rest? I also need to pick some new spells. I had to get
            'Seeds to Soldiers'. The other spells I thought about before, did I
            really want to get the spells that helped with farming...
          </p>
          {/* decided to put 5 points into Vitality, staying alive was a
            must after all. For now, my opponents are crows, rats and other pests
            so that is fine.  */}
          <p>
            Ah screw it, I'll get the farming spells, I have more then enough points. If I join the military I
            can just say they are survival skills.. Lightning germination,
            growth and harvest. This better be worth it. Now I had the spells
            unlocked I could read their description in full.
          </p>
          {/*  Apart from lightning seeds, there was also:
            Lightning germination, Seeds to soldiers, Lightning growth,

          <p>Lightning germination: Stimulate a target into germinating.</p>
          <p>
            I picked up a random seed in the field, sure enough it started to
            sprout. I am never going to level this spell up, it's useless. What
            would even happen if I did level it up? There is not even an amount
            of seeds just 'Target'.
          </p>
          {/* During germination, repair processes are activated to deal with accumulated DNA damage. - Kind of heal & Quality */}

          <p>Lightning growth: Force the target to grow.</p>
          <p>
            I tried to use the spell on a certain body part after reading that
            description, no luck.
          </p>
          {/* Increases quality of plant & stats given - buff spell */}
          <p>Lightning harvest: Harvest the target.</p>
          {/* Quality of harvested materials */}
          <p>
            After forcing the germinated seed to grow into a plant, I tired to
            harvest it. The plant fell apart, nothing but waste was left in my
            hand. I guess I was impressed with growth, the thing did not even
            need to be put in the soil to grow, although that left it without
            roots. I thought perhaps the harvest failed, like how lightning seed
            sometimes misses so I tired it again on three other seeds.
          </p>

            It was the same result each time. The fourth time however I heard a
            noise that happens when you try to put something in your inventory
            but it's full. I looked inside and sure enough was my lunch and 4
            harvested plants. One in each box. I decided to inspect the plants.
          </p>
          <p>Bacon Leaf: Quality: 10.</p>
          <p>
            Bacon leaf!? I tried to eat it but it tasted of raw bacon. I will
            cook them later.

            I had been waiting to try this one out the most. I cast a spell on a
            random seed in the field. A plant-man grew in front of me, with skin
            like the leaf I just tried to eat. I tried to inspect it, but like
            when I try to inspect humans, nothing readable came up. Do you think
            he will be angry I tried to eat his brother?
          </p>
          <p>
            He just kind of stood there though, unmoving. I told it to go kill
            the rats in the forest, it ran in the direction of the forest and I
            heard explosions go off. Maybe I should of told him about the
            explosions. When I arrived on the floor was what remained of an
            exploded rat and shredded bacon-leaf everywhere.
