          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            I woke in a soft bed, my arm felt like the blood has been drained
            from it so I pulled it back towards me and along with it came Tsuma.
            Can't complain. So I just led in the bed awhile longer the sun
            slowly creeping up the bed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few hours later I was back in class. I had magic class with Lubin
            in the morning for one hour, a break and then lightning classes for
            one hour. After that we where suppose to be in our club activities
            until lunch. After lunch was our normal training. Today being the
            first day since my class had changed from Mage to KÊ¼awiil I found
            there where a few small problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a start the magic classes where about the Mage class. The only
            parts of the lecture I could use where bits on the human race skills
            which was in the past the least relevant as I wanted to be a combat
            mage and not really the party leader. Also the lessons about mana
            and magic in a more general sense. I could only hope to get though
            any practical parts of the lessons by using the stress of just
            coming back as a reason why I could no longer cast manaball. Not
            sure how long I could keep this up for. Lubin ended the lesson by
            saying. "Next class we are looking at the stun skill, this is really
            useful for those of you looking to join the military, security
            forces, honestly since it is non-lethal it is a really useful skill.
            I would recommend you to get it but I will not force you I know some
            of you have your own family builds etc. See you next class."
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought at first at least I had a lightning element class, so the
            lightning lessons would still be useful to me. That was true, the
            lessons where very helpful in understanding the lightning elemental
            and how to control it. It's just the color of my lightning had
            changed. Very visibly so. On top of that I had to use the same act
            from earlier this morning as a reason why I could no longer produce
            lightning spells I could use only before hand.
          </p>

          <p>I was going to get caught out at some point.</p>

          <p>
            I was suppose to go to a club until lunch time, I wrote down that I
            would join the martialist club. I assume I could get away with
            missing one week, or changing clubs. After all I had just been set
            back to level one, if I went like this it would be too obvious, even
            if I kept up my on physical body to its peak I would fall behind
            those with stat points in dexterity, strength and vitality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to head straight for the canteen, I would use my lunch
            token to get my lunch now and then take it over to the training
            areas. They keep monsters near the arena for testing students, there
            must be a way for me to register to fight some of them. I grabbed
            bead, a sausage and some cheese for my lunch, then headed to the
            arena area.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wondered around the arena, once I got near area they kept monsters
            in a man stopped me at the door. "Students are suppose to be doing
            clubs now, I think you are lost. Only teachers can come inside here
            anyway, it's full of monsters." The man said. I quickly apologized
            and told him I must of gotten lost and walked away. There goes my
            master plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walked pasted the strength testing area and decided to check out
            my ranking, there where some people gathered around it. They where
            from a body building club. I told them I was just walking past and
            wanted to check my ranking on the board quickly, they become more
            interested in me until while looking for my name on the rankings, I
            could not find it. I don't understand I was rank 4th for this years
            students, yes only the top 100 where on display unless you searched
            with your mana inside of the pillar but how could I of lost my place
            already? I scanned the pillar to find my new ranking, but it told
            me. "User is not found."
          </p>

          <p>
            Was it because my class had changed also? My mana had changed? The
            body builders tried to console me, saying if I keep trying I can get
            back in to the top 100 again! I could only thank that they
            misunderstood my reaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I could leave they insisted on showing me how they train so
            that I could become stronger in the future. I was expecting them to
            be lifting weights like some of the military I had seen in the past.
            There was a boy on the ground doing an impersonation of an ape,
            hitting his fists into the floor, on his chest and then into a
            strength testing device. 20!? "What level is this guy?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "15, it's a human perk. Ape Mode, increases strength damage with
            bare fists for a period of time, while decreasing your defences." A
            student replied. These people where mad. So I walked off while they
            were watching him.
