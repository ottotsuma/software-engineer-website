            A small party of students and a handful of adults had arrived from
            Swexausern in the afternoon. They would camp out in an open space
            near Dog Forge, a part of town near the castle. After which, as a
            larger group, we would all set off south together. The students from
            Swexausern were not totally unknown to all of us, some of us would
            go north with our parents or they come south, that was if those
            parents were traders or guards to traders.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Instead of playing and chatting with our friends into the night we
            were ushered home early tonight. Some of the students did not
            understand why at first. This happened ever year though, our parents
            would be saying good bye, making sure we were ready to head off into
            the world. Although we were heading to academy's, schools and
            military camps; it was our departure from the nest.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            In the morning the adults that came with the students headed back
            north, replaced by some of our own parents and village elders. I was
            glad my mother would be coming along, although she made it clear she
            would be heading back when they arrived at the next town.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            The trip was a short one. I had walked with my mother the whole
            time, asking her questions about what to do and look out for on the
            way there. She had told me the trip to the camp I was going to was
            not so far. Also that I should keep my mind on the camp itself. She
            had gone to the same camp in the past and let me know that it was
            not an easy thing to adjust to. It would be hard work, especially
            for a girl who had never been to a city before. The camp I was going
            to was near the city of Grafen. A large city, far bigger than any
            town I had been to in the past. Or so she told me.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Steinauhau to Todtenwei was around 8 hours. So again the arriving
            students, myself included this time, would set up camp and rest.
            Unlike Steinauhau Todtenwei had a river running though the town,
            although it had no port and was not a major trading post smaller
            ships could come up river and trade. I had been here before with my
            mother, she had taken me when I was younger, because I had begged
            her to for days. Nobody wanted to stay stuck in one town forever, so
            I had begged to go with her every time she set off with a merchant.
            It was not often she went after having children, she said she use to
            go more but preferred to do her duties closer to home now. Last time
            we came the town was not nearly as busy as it was today.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            As we approached the town we could all see a larger then usual ship
            sitting in the river. It was a Galley, a kind of ship that used oars
            and sails, most trade ships would just use sails and only have oars
            for an emergency. Hiring a full crew of rowers would of ruined any
            profit you could of made otherwise.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            At first all the students, myself included, thought this was a war
            galley, the kind the navy used. The adults knew better however. This
            galley was wider, and rather then the open deck for soldiers to use
            during combat, it had a very large cabin a top. Almost blocking the
            view of the captain. It's most distinguishing feature though was the
            sails were sporting royal insignia and colors. The witch of Alden
            burning a feathered dragon, a knight with ultra-violet purple
            lightning (紫气东来), running up his spear, lodged inside the same
            feathered dragon.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            You could tell which royal was aboard by the supporting flags flown
            from the cabin. Crown prince, heir apparent, Alphonse Elzach. His
            was simple, his sword 'Kojkan' being shoved though his crown. It was
            said the crown was on top, but it just looked like he shoved the
            sword though it. Kojkan was a strange name, even for a sword. This
            sword was suppose to have magic powers, be very old, and passed down
            to the heir to commemorate his position. It looked dirty. It was
            black like dried blood, even the blade, like the thing was never
            rubbed clean.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Oh well, non of that was my business anyway. The town had not
            changed from when I last visited all those years ago. Mother and the
            other adults stayed with us for the night in tents near Red Borough
            the district next to the castle.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            In the morning the adults from our village set off back over the
            bridge and back to home. My mother left me with some kind words, a
            kiss, and a shield. I knew what role I wanted to take in the future.
            While everyone at the army camp would be a Fighter class we would
            all proreform different roles in a real fight. I wanted to be the
            Tank, the role was to protect the rest of the team from the monsters
            attacks. My mother was also a Tank when she fought, she had tried to
            persuade me against it a few times but in the end I would not budge.
            The shield she left me was one she had used in the past, she had it
            repaired and re-painted for me.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            On the front of the shield was light blue with two golden stags down
            the middle. This was the banner of Steinauhau, the shield originally
            had the banner of Soldenheim on, my mothers home town. It was
            something I quite liked, although it was not unique my family was
            not noble so we were not allowed to have our own banner, however
            most students would be using the banner of Alden not their home
            towns, so it was somewhat different. The final detail that stood out
            for me the most though was on the inside of the shield she had
            painted the words 'You Are Loved' right at the top near the rim so I
            would always see them.

          {/* Alphonse -  In the arena, 30 had been commended to die. Malnourished and with cuts and bruises still healing from rough treatment by their jailors. They were completely naked and jeered at spitefully by the crowd. Each has their hands tied behind their back, standing on a long plank of wood resting on a fulcrum. Suddenly there is a loud grown of scraping wood and the clanking of chains, 20 beasts are raised though the floor from the network under the arena. They have been deliberately kept starving for today. They took no time to spot their prey and with a loud screaming roar each charged forward. The panicked prisoners watch the beasts approach, in a flash the beasts are upon them, the first leap out of the way rising high into the air on the long plank of wood, safe for a moment from mutilation that would of been their destiny if they had remained on the ground. However this temporary respite comes at a cost, the men at the other end of the plank are each lowered towards the ground, with the beasts below. Their faces, legs, torsoes are ripped apart with pincers, claws and fangs. The lucky ones are killed quickly, while the others are ripped torn and devoured while they are still alive and screaming. Some of them blind with fear leap into the air, sending their opposite side down into the beasts. The beasts tare into them, the whole thing is a perverse game of seeing who will die last, although death is inevitable for everyone involved. */}
          <p>
            The closest school was the military camp for fighters and rouges,
            they were septate camps by close to each other. There were camps all
            over Alden so students never really had to travel that far unless
            they were like the remainder of us. Either going to Alden's capital
            to learn from the specialist schools of art, finance, dance, etc. Or
            like myself going to Banderedam and joining the magic academy. Alden
            only had one magic academy so students no matter how far would have
            to make their way there. Although the journey to this point had been
            as expected where small monsters where driven off by the numbers or
            guardians the road to Banderedam traveled close to Huonhia and near
            an area often overrun by monsters. It was a rainforest where a few
            major rivers became one and followed into the sea, if it where not
            for the abundance of monsters it is likely this would be the
            location of some major cities.

          <Otto>
            I found myself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He
            had the makings of a small mustache on his upper lip, a refined
            pointed nose and a bit of acne around his cheeks.
          </Otto>
          <p>
            "Names Leon, if you care to ask" The tall boy said in a upbeat tone.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I starring?" I replied a bit embarrassed.</p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2
            days now." Leon gave a small smile as if the whole thing was a
            little amusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, I am sorry..." I replied embarrassed I had only just noticed
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking
            for awhile." He asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Steinauhau" I responded.</p>
          <p>
            "...doesn't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to
            Chingaling land before?" He asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderedam." I
            replied confused. I did not know everywhere in Alden, I was only 14
            but I never heard of Chingaling.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, sorry forgot my place, that's correct, how silly of me." He
            apologized in a strange way.
          </p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?" I asked. Did he think I would know?</p>
          <p>Leon stared at me. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>
            "Wouldn't of asked if I did." I replied almost with an eye roll.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Suppose so. Well Chingaling was a country before, made up of people
            from Hathapatson to Dodgud. Alden and Huonhia split the country in
            two and claimed it for their own. Although the official story is the
            people of Banderedam where demon worshipers so Alden occupied that
            area and Huonhia occupied the rest to protect the people from Alden.
            I suppose the truth depends on who you ask." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So you must be local then?" I asked, since I don't even know the
            towns he mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, yeah, born in Banderedam. Still live there now with my little
            sister and little brother." He replied happily.
          </p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?" I added.</p>
          <p>
            "Monsters. Ethautenheim to Banderedam passes through the province of
            Bilkotgopia. Risky trip, but pays well. Work at Banderedam depends
            on the ports and the academy. So both do poorly in the winter, so
            trips like this one to the southern towns to make trades can be
            profitable." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel,
            less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway." He said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Makes sense. You can blend in easily because of your age, is it not
            a risk for you to tell me all this?" I asked. His sentences were
            short and oddly spaced. Maybe he was nervous since it was his first
            time also.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time,
            and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection." He said
            seemingly less jittery now.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know
            the area." I said without much thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            "That is true, but I am no fighter. I am training as a shop keeper,
            an apprentice. You know, if I get back." He admitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You'll make it back, I am sure. There are guards with us, even more
            then the other stretches of this trip." I said looking at the people
            carrying spears & javelins.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yes, but accidents happen, fights get chaotic. When I traveled down
            with a merchant group a mercenary died fighting a giant centipede.
            It ripped his head from his body with it's giant pincers around its
            mouth." Leon described acting out the actions with his hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I paused to think, he has a point but since this trip happens every
            year they must of made special arrangements for the children's trip.
            After all even some nobles sent their kids off to the academy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leon interrupted my thoughts with "you're a mage? where is your
            wand? If you really have no wand you can pick one up in Banderedam,
            being so close to the Mages academy means they often stock those
            kind of things."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I want to get one." I replied. Although I am not sure if I can
            afford it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, at Pal's shop it seems wands are the most sort after product.
            Maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into
            buying wands." He joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same
            books to start with." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continued walking through the forest in a long snaking line,
            occasionally talking to each other when I said. "There is a lot of
            noise coming from up ahead." Sure everyone was talking or
            complaining their feet hurt but this was different.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe they are drunk. Sounds like they are play fighting." Leon
            joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are
            play fighting like little kids at a time like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Into the northern trees, if we are lucky we can go around." Leon
            said dashing off to the left.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?" I shouted looking
            at his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chance of monsters is still lower then defiantly monsters" He
            replied moving deeper in.
          </p>
          {/* This really needs to come up when you get to the academy... */}
          <p>
            "But the guards." Before I could finish my sentence I saw a a guard
            cut down a 14 year old girl. From neck through the body and out
            through the opposite side, just above the hip. To far to hear what
            the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the students.
            Following Leon, I ran as fast as I could until they where just
            beyond the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and
            dirt above his head, I saw Leon looking pale as he tried to slow his
            breathing.
          </p>
          <p>"Welcome to Bilkotgopia." He said as I walked closer.</p>
          <p>
            "That some kind of joke?" I asked confused by his sense of humor.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, sorry, a dark one. Close to the truth though. In Bilkotgopia
            people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong
            monsters rarely travel across into Alden." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So what is the truth?" I asked, confused by what I just saw, I
            decided to explain what I saw after he had run off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a noble took a liking to the girl and she refused and hurt
            him so he had his guard put her in her place." Leon said like it
            normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deciding it was getting now where I said. "Like you said, you are
            not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river? I saw it on the
            map, we should be close right?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Y-Yeah I can. After that we follow the river takes us to
            Banderedam." He said decisively.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The river safe?" I asked offering a hand to pull him out of his
            hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahem.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is." He said with an
            awkward smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Let's move, even if it is not monsters and just an upset noble I
            don't want to get caught up in it."
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon nodded and they crawled out. We made our way through the forest
            towards the river, the sounds of battle kept coming from where the
            students were, making me wonder what was going on. We ran until the
            sounds had died out and then just walked. After a while of walking I
            wondered if Leon knew where he was going.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could hear a strange sound coming from the somewhere up ahead.
            "Can you hear. Moaning?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Like an old man waking up." Leon joked.</p>
          <p>
            Pushing apart the branches Leon peered forward. In front of him on
            the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The
            dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others, the
            same age as myself and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and
            face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left
            had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there
            was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completely removed
            along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides
            through her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and
            burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of
            it ended up back inside the girl through the gaps in his teeth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leon vomited, loudly. The half-man screamed towards Leon and dragged
            it's self across the ground at surprising speed towards him. Having
            seen Leon vomit, I rushed over to help him. Upon hearing the scream
            and seeing the moving cadaver chasing him down I tried to push my
            mana through my body and out of my hand like I had with the Kappa.
            The rush felt easier this time with all the practice I had had. The
            ball of light shined pale blue, glowing lit up the ground and trees,
            before the ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment
            giving me the chance to free Leon of his short sword. I ran towards
            the monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed
            about and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in
            a growl. Using this time, I ran in a circle to the side of the
            monster before turning on my heel, running straight for the monster
            holding the blade by my side and lunging it into the creatures head.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but
            nothing happened. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon
            back up I heard a low growl and turned to see the monster was not
            dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. I
            jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground. Grabbing
            hold of Leon's sword again and swinging it smashing the monsters
            head to pieces over and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself, and taking serval
            glances at that thing. I started to search the dead girl, finding on
            her some coins, accessories, an ID and a few school supplies and
            food.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Guess she wasn't a rich girl." I said to myself. Grabbing the ID
            'Lea Müller'. "You know her?" I asked Leon showing him the ID, it
            was just a piece of card with her name and information on.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, it's an Alden name. Not a local." He said wiping his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Okay, well we can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the
            town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here." I
            said moving past the bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The river was just past were we found the student, the water was
            murky like it was full of old milk mixed in with the water. The
            other students would go around the same river further up stream.
            That would take them past the source of the river and around so they
            would not have to cross the water itself. Since we had run
            downstream we would have to cross the river. "Leon, is the water
            always this color?" I asked looking into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not further down, just up here. People say it is because of the
            chalk in the ground that causes it while others say it is the
            monsters living in the river this far up. Either way don't touch
            it." He said with a serious face.
          </p>
          <p>
            We walked along the river bank until we found some dead trees and
            pushed them across the river to make a bridge. Leon went first since
            it was his idea to come this way and walked across the tree while I
            held it still on my side. I say held it still, the tree was really
            thick and long, so it was not like I helped a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Leon got across he held the tree on the opposite side and I
            walked across the tree. I tried to keep low and move quickly. When I
            was almost one third of the way across my leg sunk into the tree and
            I lost my balance and landed on the tree hugging it. Once I realised
            what happened I laughed a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old tree was a little hollow I guess. I tried to pull myself
            back up but my foot was wedged into the hole. Then a pair of
            vertical oval shaped eyes appeared in the river looking up at me. My
            face felt cold and my limbs numb.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea what that thing was looking at me. It sure was no fish
            since the eyes were next to each other like a human. I dragged my
            foot as hard as I could against the tree bark trying to break free.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I struggled the eyes soon moved up out of the murky river. The
            face the eyes belonged to was pale white with patches of pink.
            However it was far from human with oily looking skin and where a
            human has a nose was just droopy sack. The mouth became clearer as
            it moved further up. It's mouth looked like a large creepy smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            I managed to rip my foot through the trunk of the tree and started
            to dash across the tree towards Leon. Leon's face was pale and
            sweaty watching what was happening, I just dashed towards him as
            fast as I could with my arms spread out trying to keep my balance. I
            heard a thud and the tree shake, followed by the sound of the bark
            of the tree ripping. I fell down and clung into the tree as Leon
            shouted "Don't stop just run!" I picked myself up and ran as fast as
            I could along the tree which started to fall behind me and pick up
            Leon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran until the tree start to pull Leon off the ground, I pushed all
            of my power into my legs sprinted to the end of the tree which was
            ever more being pulled into the air on Leon's side and down into the
            river on the other end. I jumped off and onto Leon, we scrabbled
            away from the river bank and looked back. The only thing I saw was
            the half a tree floating down the river and the eyes looking at up
            us slowly sink back down.
          </p>
          <p>"What the hell was that!?" I screamed at Leon.</p>
          <p>
            "I have no idea! I never even heard rumors of something like that
            before." He replied in a flustered tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I really thought I would be eaten like the girl before, except by a
            weird river monster. What the hell is going on around here?" I said
            moving away from the river more.
          </p>
          <p>
            "This part of Alden is next to the monster territory. Maybe more of
            them got through then normal with the soldiers being taken towards
            the republic more and more." He replied following after me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Either way there are defiantly monsters here so are we close to
            Banderdam?" I asked a little frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah. The main road is up ahead now we are past the river it should
            be safe to rejoin the road." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>"What about the guards that attacked the students?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "I mean we should rejoin as normal citizens. The city is busy this
            time of year, although it is coming to an end there should still be
            other people going into the city." Leon suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            And like that we left the dangers of the rainforest behind and
            walked to Banderdam.
