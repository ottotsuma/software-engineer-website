          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            The students of the town would all head off on the same day, they
            would travel to septate destinations and along the way change the
            adults traveling with them, at first the instructors of the town
            hall traveled with them until they reached the town of Todtenwei.
            From there they would change guardians every town, village or city
            until their destinations. Between Todtenwei and Shomberg was the 2nd
            Regiment of Aldens camp, there where many Fighters who would join
            the training camps near by and once the remainder of the group
            joined the main road south they lost the majority of the other
            students are the large Grafen military training camp. The group
            would further split at the Lobach river where the 3rd regiment of
            Alden where based, those heading north from here went to the capital
            Alden or Banderedam near the Mages academy. South would be heading
            Haisengen and then into Huonhia. The group would continue to split
            and have new students join all the way until Argavereri. Although
            the journey to this point had been as expected where small monsters
            where driven off by the numbers or guardians the road to Banderedam
            traveled close to Huonhia and near an area often overrun by
            monsters. It was a rainforest where a few major rivers became one
            and followed into the sea, if it where not for the abundance of
            monsters it is likely this would be the location of some major
            cities.

            I found myself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He
            had the makings of a small mustache on his upper lip, a refined
            pointed nose and a bit of acne around his cheeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Names Leon, if you care to ask" The tall boy said in a upbeat tone.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I starring?" I replied a bit embarrassed.</p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2
            days now." Leon gave a small smile as if the whole thing was a
            little amusing.
          </p>
          <p>"Ah, I am sorry..."</p>
          <p>
            "It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking
            for awhile."
          </p>
          <p>"Steinauhau"</p>
          <p>
            "...doesn't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to
            Chingaling land before?"
          </p>
          <p>"Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderedam."</p>
          <p>"Ah, sorry forgot my place, thats correct, how silly of me."</p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?"</p>
          <p>Leon stared at me. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>"wouldn't of asked if I did."</p>
          <p>
            "Suppose so, thought you were just a die hard Alden, well Chingaling
            was a country before, made up of people from Hathapatson to Dodgud.
            Alden and Huonhia split the country in two and claimed it for their
            own. Although the official story is the people of Banderedam where
            demon worshipers so Alden occupied that area and Huonhia occupied
            the rest to protect the people from Alden. I suppose the truth
            depends on who you ask."
          </p>
          <p>"So you must be local then?"</p>
          <p>
            "Aha, yeah, born in Banderedam. Still live there now with my little
            sister and little brother."
          </p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?"</p>
          <p>
            "Monsters, Ethautenheim to Banderedam passes though the province of
            Bilkotgopia. Risky trip but pays well, work at Banderedam depends on
            the ports and the academy. Both do poorly in the winter."
          </p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?"</p>
          <p>
            "First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel,
            less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Makes sense you can blend in easily because of your age, is it not
            a risk for you to tell me all this?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time,
            and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know
            the area."
          </p>
          <p>
            "That is true, but I am no fighter, I am training as a shop keeper,
            an apprentice. You know, if I get back."
          </p>
          <p>
            "You'll make it back, I am sure. There are nobles kids in this group
            the guard's won't let the monsters near them."
          </p>
          <p>"Yes, near them. But we are not them."</p>
          <p>
            I paused to think, he has a point but if we are just near by they
            will have to protect us even if they don't mean to.
          </p>

            Leon interrupted my thoughts with "you're a mage with no wand? I
            think that is fine I have seen loads of mages without wands. If you
            really have to have a wand you can pick one up in Banderedam, being
            so close to the Mages collage means they often stock those kind of
            things."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I still want to get one though"</p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Yeah, looking at Pal's shop it seems many students think the
            same way, maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing
            you into buying wands."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the
            same books to start with."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "There is a lot of noise coming from those nobles up ahead.
            Didn't think they could get any louder."
          </p>
          <p>Leon - "Drunk no doubt. Sounds like they are play fighting."</p>
          <p>
            Otto and Leon turn to look at each other realising there is no way
            they are play fighting like little kids at a time like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Into the northern tree's, if we are lucky we can go around."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?"</p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Chance of monsters is still lower then defiantly monsters"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "But the guards." Before I could finish my sentence I saw a
            nobles guard cut down a 14 year old girl from neck though the body
            and out though the opposite side just above the hip. To far to hear
            what the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the other
            students. Following Leon, I ran as fast as I could until they where
            just beyond the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and
            dirt above our heads, I was looking pale as Leon tried to slow his
            breathing.
          </p>
          <p>Leon - "Welcome to Bilkotgopia."</p>
          <p>Otto - "That some kind of joke?"</p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Yeah, sorry. A dark one, close to the truth. In Bilkotgopia
            people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong
            monsters rarely travel across into Alden."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Truth and lies must be hard to tell apart here."</p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Yeah, at least im upfront about which side I am on, I won't
            be turning against you. I just want to go home."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Like you said you are not a fighter, but can you guide us to
            the river just past this... mess"
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon - "Polite way to put it, but yes I can. After that we follow
            the river takes us to Banderedam."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "The river safe?"</p>
          <p>Leon - "Ahem.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Let's move before we have time to take in what happened or
            worse it comes this way."
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon nods and they crawl out and make their way though the forest
            towards the river, any sound of battle had died out they where too
            far from the road now to hear anything anyway. After 90 minutes of
            walking they where getting to where they wanted to be, Leon had been
            following signs and markings left behind by his people, signs to
            help them avoid the guards but Otto did not need to know that.
          </p>
          <p>Leon - "Can you hear. Moaning?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like an old man waking up."</p>
          <p>
            Pushing apart the branches Leon peered forward and in front of him
            on the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The
            dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others, the
            same age as myself and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and
            face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left
            had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there
            was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completely removed
            along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides
            though her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and
            burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of
            it ended up back inside the girl though the gaps in his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon vomited, loudly. The monster screamed towards Leon and dragged
            it's self at surprising speed towards him. Having seen Leon vomit I
            rushed over to help him, upon hearing the scream and seeing the
            moving cadaver chasing them down I tried to push my mana though my
            body and out of my hand like I had with the Kappa. The rush felt
            easier this time with all the practice I had had, the ball of light
            shined, pale blue glow shone off the ground and trees before the
            ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment giving me
            the chance to free Leon of his short sword, I ran towards the
            monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed about
            and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in a
            growl. Using this time I ran in a circle to the side of the monster
            before turning on his heel, running straight for the monster holding
            the blade by my side and lunging it into the creatures head.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but
            nothing happened. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon
            back up I heard a low growl and turned to see the monster was not
            dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. I
            jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground before
            grabbing hold of Leon's sword again and swinging it smashing the
            monsters head to pieces over and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself, I started to search
            the dead student, finding on her some coins, accessories and a few
            school supplies and food.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Guess she wasn't a rich girl." Grabbing the ID card 'Lea
            Müller'. "You know her?"
          </p>
          <p>Leon - "No, Alden name, not from here."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Makes sense, can't carry her so I will take the ID card to
            the town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here."
          </p>

          <p>
            Making their way back to the river, we where on the other side of
            the river to the main route. Since they had passed into Tirnavalli
            they could see a few boats moving down the river, and a few coming
            up. They manage to flag down some passing guards and explained their
            story to them, I gave over the students ID and told them where they
            could find the bodies. we then joined them in the boat on the way to
            Banderedam.
