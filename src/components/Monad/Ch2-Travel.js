          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            All of the students from town set off on the same day. We traveled
            to septate destinations and along the way change the adults
            traveling with us. At first the instructors of the town school
            traveled with us until we reached the town of Todtenwei, the next
            town along. From there we changed guardians every town, village or
            city until our destinations. The closest school was the military
            camp for fighters and rouges, they were septate camps by close to
            each other. There were camps all over Alden so students never really
            had to travel that far unless they were like the remainder of us.
            Either going to Alden's capital to learn from the specialist schools
            of art, finance, dance, etc. Or like myself going to Banderedam and
            joining the magic academy. Alden only had one magic academy so
            students no matter how far would have to make their way there.
            Although the journey to this point had been as expected where small
            monsters where driven off by the numbers or guardians the road to
            Banderedam traveled close to Huonhia and near an area often overrun
            by monsters. It was a rainforest where a few major rivers became one
            and followed into the sea, if it where not for the abundance of
            monsters it is likely this would be the location of some major
            cities.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found myself walking next to a tall boy with short brown hair. He
            had the makings of a small mustache on his upper lip, a refined
            pointed nose and a bit of acne around his cheeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Names Leon, if you care to ask" The tall boy said in a upbeat tone.
          </p>
          <p>"Oh sorry, was I starring?" I replied a bit embarrassed.</p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2
            days now." Leon gave a small smile as if the whole thing was a
            little amusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, I am sorry..." I replied embarrassed I had only just noticed
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's fine, you from far? you look tired, like you have been walking
            for awhile." He asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Steinauhau" I responded.</p>
          <p>
            "...doesn't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to
            Chingaling land before?" He asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderedam." I
            replied confused. I did not know everywhere in Alden, I was only 14
            but I never heard of Chingaling.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, sorry forgot my place, thats correct, how silly of me." He
            apologized in a strange way.
          </p>
          <p>"What is Chingaling land?" I asked. Did he think I would know?</p>
          <p>Leon stared at me. "You really don't know?"</p>
          <p>
            "Wouldn't of asked if I did." I replied almost with an eye roll.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Suppose so. Well Chingaling was a country before, made up of people
            from Hathapatson to Dodgud. Alden and Huonhia split the country in
            two and claimed it for their own. Although the official story is the
            people of Banderedam where demon worshipers so Alden occupied that
            area and Huonhia occupied the rest to protect the people from Alden.
            I suppose the truth depends on who you ask." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So you must be local then?" I asked, since I don't even know the
            towns he mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, yeah, born in Banderedam. Still live there now with my little
            sister and little brother." He replied happily.
          </p>
          <p>"Erm your parents?" I added.</p>
          <p>
            "Monsters. Ethautenheim to Banderedam passes though the province of
            Bilkotgopia. Risky trip, but pays well. Work at Banderedam depends
            on the ports and the academy. So both do poorly in the winter, so
            trips like this one to the southern towns to make trades can be
            profitable." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>"So you make this trip every year?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "First time. I didn't dare go outside of when the students travel,
            less guards. Less of the ones that will help you anyway." He said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Makes sense. You can blend in easily because of your age, is it not
            a risk for you to tell me all this?" I asked. His sentences were
            short and oddly spaced. Maybe he was nervous since it was his first
            time also.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not particularly. It is no crime to travel at the same time,
            and traveling in numbers offers its own kind of protection." He said
            seemingly less jittery now.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well I am glad to have you with me, if we get lost you must know
            the area." I said without much thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            "That is true, but I am no fighter. I am training as a shop keeper,
            an apprentice. You know, if I get back." He admitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You'll make it back, I am sure. There are guards with us, even more
            then the other stretches of this trip." I said looking at the people
            carrying spears & javelins.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yes, but accidents happen, fights get chaotic. When I traveled down
            with a merchant group a mercenary died fighting a giant centipede.
            It ripped his head from his body with it's giant pincers around its
            mouth." Leon described acting out the actions with his hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I paused to think, he has a point but since this trip happens every
            year they must of made special arrangements for the children's trip.
            After all even some nobles sent their kids off to the academy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leon interrupted my thoughts with "you're a mage? where is your
            wand? If you really have no wand you can pick one up in Banderedam,
            being so close to the Mages academy means they often stock those
            kind of things."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I want to get one." I replied. Although I am not sure if I can
            afford it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, at Pal's shop it seems wands are the most sort after product.
            Maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into
            buying wands." He joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same
            books to start with." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continued walking though the forest in a long snaking line,
            occasionally talking to each other when I said. "There is a lot of
            noise coming from up ahead." Sure everyone was talking or
            complaining their feet hurt but this was different.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe they are drunk. Sounds like they are play fighting." Leon
            joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are
            play fighting like little kids at a time like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Into the northern trees, if we are lucky we can go around." Leon
            said dashing off to the left.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Won't there just be more monsters in the trees?" I shouted looking
            at his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chance of monsters is still lower then defiantly monsters" He
            replied moving deeper in.
          </p>
          {/* This really needs to come up when you get to the academy... */}
          <p>
            "But the guards." Before I could finish my sentence I saw a a guard
            cut down a 14 year old girl. From neck though the body and out
            though the opposite side, just above the hip. To far to hear what
            the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the students.
            Following Leon, I ran as fast as I could until they where just
            beyond the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and
            dirt above his head, I saw Leon looking pale as he tried to slow his
            breathing.
          </p>
          <p>"Welcome to Bilkotgopia." He said as I walked closer.</p>
          <p>
            "That some kind of joke?" I asked confused by his sense of humor.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, sorry, a dark one. Close to the truth though. In Bilkotgopia
            people go missing, it's always blamed on the monsters but strong
            monsters rarely travel across into Alden." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So what is the truth?" I asked, confused by what I just saw, I
            decided to explain what I saw after he had run off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a nobel took a liking to the girl and she refused and hurt
            him so he had his guard put her in her place." Leon said like it
            normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deciding it was getting now where I said. "Like you said, you are
            not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river? I saw it on the
            map, we should be close right?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Y-Yeah I can. After that we follow the river takes us to
            Banderedam." He said decisively.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The river safe?" I asked offering a hand to pull him out of his
            hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahem.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is." He said with an
            awkward smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Let's move, even if it is not monsters and just an upset noble I
            don't want to get caught up in it."
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon nodded and they crawled out. We made our way though the forest
            towards the river, the sounds of battle kept coming from where the
            students were, making me wonder what was going on. We ran until the
            sounds had died out and then just walked. After a while of walking I
            wondered if Leon knew where he was going.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could hear a strange sound coming from the somewhere up ahead.
            "Can you hear. Moaning?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Like an old man waking up." Leon joked.</p>
          <p>
            Pushing apart the branches Leon peered forward. In front of him on
            the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The
            dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others, the
            same age as myself and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and
            face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left
            had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there
            was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completely removed
            along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides
            though her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and
            burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of
            it ended up back inside the girl though the gaps in his teeth.
          </p>
          {/* Here */}
          <p>
            Leon vomited, loudly. The half-man screamed towards Leon and dragged
            it's self at surprising speed towards him. Having seen Leon vomit I
            rushed over to help him, upon hearing the scream and seeing the
            moving cadaver chasing them down I tried to push my mana though my
            body and out of my hand like I had with the Kappa. The rush felt
            easier this time with all the practice I had had. The ball of light
            shined pale blue, glowing lit up the ground and trees before the
            ball spiraled forward blinding the monster for a moment giving me
            the chance to free Leon of his short sword. I ran towards the
            monster and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed about
            and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in a
            growl. Using this time, I ran in a circle to the side of the monster
            before turning on my heel, running straight for the monster holding
            the blade by my side and lunging it into the creatures head.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but
            nothing happened. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon
            back up I heard a low growl and turned to see the monster was not
            dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. I
            jumped around as the monster made swings from the ground. Grabbing
            hold of Leon's sword again and swinging it smashing the monsters
            head to pieces over and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself, I started to search
            the dead girl, finding on her some coins, accessories, an ID and a
            few school supplies and food.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Guess she wasn't a rich girl." I said to myself. Grabbing the ID
            'Lea Müller'. "You know her?" I asked Leon showing him the ID, it
            was just a piece of paper with her name and information on.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, it's an Alden name. Not a local." He said wiping his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Okay, well we can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the
            town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here." I
            said moving past the bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The river was just past were we found the student, the water was
            murky like it was full of old milk mixed in with the water. The
            other students would go around the same river further up stream.
            That would take them past the source of the river and around so they
            would not have to cross the water itself. Since we had run
            downstream we would have to cross the river. "Leon, is the water
            always this color?" I asked looking into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not further down, just up here. People say it is because of the
            chalk in the ground that causes it while others say it is the
            monsters living in the river this far up. Either way don't touch
            it." He said with a serious face.
          </p>
          <p>
            We walked along the river bank until we found some dead trees and
            pushed them across the river to make a bridge. Leon went first since
            it was his idea to come this way and walked across the tree while I
            held it still on my side. I say held it still, the tree was really
            thick and long, so it was not like I helped a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Leon got across he held the tree on the opposite side and I
            walked across the tree. I tried to keep low and move quickly. When I
            was almost one third of the way across my leg sunk into the tree and
            I lost my balance and landed on the tree hugging it. Once I realised
            what happened I laughed a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old tree was a little hollow I guess. I tried to pull myself
            back up but my foot was wedged into the hole. Then a pair of
            vertical oval shaped eyes appeared in the river looking up at me. My
            face felt cold and my limbs numb.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea what that thing was looking at me. It sure was no fish
            since the eyes were next to each other like a human. I dragged my
            foot as hard as I could against the tree bark trying to break free.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I struggled the eyes soon moved up out of the murky river. The
            face the eyes belonged to was pale white with patches of pink.
            However it was far from human with oily looking skin and where a
            human has a nose was just droopy sack. The mouth became clearer as
            it moved further up. It's mouth looked like a large creepy smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            I managed to rip my foot though the trunk of the tree and started to
            dash across the tree towards Leon. Leon's face was pale and sweaty watching what was happening, I just dashed towards him as fast as I could with my arms spread out trying to keep my balance.
