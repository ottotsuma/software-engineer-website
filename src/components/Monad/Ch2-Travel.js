          <Effi>
            A small party of students and a handful of adults had arrived from
            Swexausern in the afternoon. They would camp out in an open space
            near Dog Forge, a part of town near the castle. After which, as a
            larger group, we would all set off south together. The students from
            Swexausern were not totally unknown to all of us, some of us would
            go north with our parents or they come south, that was if those
            parents were traders or guards to traders.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Instead of playing and chatting with our friends into the night we
            were ushered home early tonight. Some of the students did not
            understand why at first. This happened ever year through, our parents
            would be saying good bye, making sure we were ready to head off into
            the world. Although we were heading to academy's, schools and
            military camps; it was our departure from the nest.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            In the morning the adults that came with the students headed back
            north, replaced by some of our own parents and village elders. I was
            glad my mother would be coming along, although she made it clear she
            would be heading back when they arrived at the next town.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            The trip was a short one. I had walked with my mother the whole
            time, asking her questions about what to do and look out for on the
            way there. She had told me the trip to the camp I was going to was
            not so far. Also that I should keep my mind on the camp itself. She
            had gone to the same camp in the past and let me know that it was
            not an easy thing to adjust to. It would be hard work, especially
            for a girl who had never been to a city before. The camp I was going
            to was near the city of Grafen. A large city, far bigger than any
            town I had been to in the past. Or so she told me.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Steinauhau to Todtenwei was around 8 hours. So again the arriving
            students, myself included this time, would set up camp and rest.
            Unlike Steinauhau Todtenwei had a river running through the town,
            although it had no port and was not a major trading post smaller
            ships could come up river and trade. I had been here before with my
            mother, she had taken me when I was younger, because I had begged
            her to for days. Nobody wanted to stay stuck in one town forever, so
            I had begged to go with her every time she set off with a merchant.
            It was not often she went after having children, she said she use to
            go more but preferred to do her duties closer to home now. Last time
            we came the town was not nearly as busy as it was today.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            As we approached the town we could all see a larger then usual ship
            sitting in the river. It was a Galley, a kind of ship that used oars
            and sails, most trade ships would just use sails and only have oars
            for an emergency. Hiring a full crew of rowers would of ruined any
            profit you could of made otherwise.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            At first all the students, myself included, thought this was a war
            galley, the kind the navy used. The adults knew better however. This
            galley was wider, and rather then the open deck for soldiers to use
            during combat, it had a very large cabin a top. Almost blocking the
            view of the captain. It's most distinguishing feature through was the
            sails were sporting royal insignia and colors. The witch of Alden
            burning a feathered dragon, a knight with ultra-violet purple
            lightning (紫气东来), running up his spear, lodged inside the same
            feathered dragon.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            You could tell which royal was aboard by the supporting flags flown
            from the cabin. Crown prince, heir apparent, Alphonse Elzach. His
            was simple, his sword 'Kojkan' being shoved through his crown. It was
            said the crown was on top, but it just looked like he shoved the
            sword through it. Kojkan was a strange name, even for a sword. This
            sword was suppose to have magic powers, be very old, and passed down
            to the heir to commemorate his position. It looked dirty. It was
            black, like dried blood, even down the blade like the thing was never
            rubbed clean.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Oh well, non of that was my business anyway. The town had not
            changed from when I last visited all those years ago. Mother and the
            other adults stayed with us for the night in tents near Red Borough
            the district next to the castle.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            In the morning the adults from our village set off back over the
            bridge and back to home. My mother left me with some kind words, a
            kiss, and a shield. I knew what role I wanted to take in the future.
            While everyone at the army camp would be a Fighter class we would
            all proreform different roles in a real fight. I wanted to be the
            Tank, the role was to protect the rest of the team from the beasts
            attacks. My mother was also a Tank when she fought, she had tried to
            persuade me against it a few times but in the end I would not budge.
            The shield she left me was one she had used in the past, she had it
            repaired and re-painted for me.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            On the front of the shield was light blue with two golden stags down
            the middle. This was the banner of Steinauhau, the shield originally
            had the banner of Soldenheim on, my mothers home town. It was
            something I quite liked, although it was not unique my family was
            not noble so we were not allowed to have our own banner, however
            most students would be using the banner of Alden not their home
            towns, so it was somewhat different. The final detail that stood out
            for me the most through was on the inside of the shield she had
            painted the words 'You Are Loved' right at the top near the rim so I
            would always see them.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            Shield and dreams in hand I grouped up with the others from our
            village, as well as the students who joined us previously. The
            students from this town would also join us on our walk south. I had
            spotted Otto traveling with us, he stayed with the other mages from
            our village although he didn't seem to speak much. I pulled him
            along with me from that point on, at least until we would reach
            Grafen he would have someone to talk to. Although that was a little
            under halfway for his journey to the mage academy.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            After we had packed up the adults of this town had joined us to take
            us to the next location. Before we left through they said the prince
            was giving an announcement in the town and it might be beneficial
            for us to watch it. After all we could afford some time, the
            distance to the next town Shomberg was the same distance back to
            Steinauhau, so easily walkable within a day.
          </Effi>
          <Effi>
            I had walked with Otto and the other students along the road to the
            south out of town. The towns district called The Stairs along the
            south road had a quickly assembled arena looking area. It was a leg
            high wooden wall in a circle, with some wooden stands here and there
            for people to watch. There were far to many students to take to the
            stands and since the wall was easy to see over even for the shortest
            of children we stood and watched.
          </Effi>
          <div className="BreakPoint" />
          <Otto>
            Effi had suddenly stopped speaking and stood looking into the
            make-shift arena. We had come here expecting a speech from a prince
            in fancy clothes.
            {/* However what lay before our eyes were people
            covered it cuts and bruises. Some being dragged over to the middle
            of the arena, all naked. Their sentence had already passed, however it seemed today
            was a demonstration by the prince, a deterrence to other aspiring criminals. */}
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            In the arena, 30 people had been commended to die. Malnourished and
            with cuts and bruises still healing from rough treatment by their
            captors. They were completely naked and jeered at spitefully by the
            crowd in the stands. Each has their hands tied behind their back,
            standing on a long plank of wood resting on a fulcrum. Suddenly
            there was a loud grown of scraping wood and the clanking of chains.
            20 beasts were set lose from cages that were out of site between the
            stands. The beasts had been deliberately kept starving for today, it
            was a common practice when using lesser beasts for hunting.
          </Otto>
          {/* <Otto>Beast Type</Otto> */}
          <Otto>
            They took no time to spot their prey, and with a loud screaming roar
            each charged forward. The panicked prisoners watch the beasts
            approach, in a flash the beasts were upon them. The first to leap
            out of the way raised high into the air on the long plank of wood,
            safe for a moment from mutilation that would of been their destiny
            if they had remained on the ground. However this temporary respite
            came at a cost, the men at the other end of the plank were each
            lowered towards the ground, with the beasts below. Their faces,
            legs, torsoes were ripped apart with pincers, claws and fangs. The
            lucky ones were killed quickly, while the others are ripped torn and
            devoured while they are still alive and screaming. Some of them
            blind with fear leap into the air, sending their opposite side down
            into the beasts. The beasts tore into them, the whole thing was a
            perverse game of seeing who will die last, although death was
            inevitable for everyone involved.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            Sitting in a wooden stand higher up then everyone else, covered in the colors of royalty, their families famed violet lighting, snow white to represent cleanliness and wealth, finally obsidian black, a resource monopolized by their family. The seats had cloth covering them, flanked by banners standing taller than knights that stood beside him. The first prince, Alphonse Elzach.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            This prince was the one who condemned these men to die, despite whatever ruling the local lord would of given. He was also the one who had chosen to do so in such an unusual fashion. The
            death sentence was not unheard of, but only reserved for the worst of
            crimes. To find 30 people in one town condemned to death. Had the
            town kept them for the prince? Or had the prince added those who
            would otherwise receive lesser punishments? Who would ever know. One
            thing was sure through, this was entertainment for the prince and his
            entourage. The smile sticking to his face was large and full of
            laughter each time those down below would fall into the beasts path.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            We had all known death before. This left a different taste in my
            mouth. Were all people form the big cities like this, or was it just
            this one prince?
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            We departed from the town right after. The walk out was quieter then when we arrived.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            The next few towns were uneventful in comparison. The next big event
            was when Effi & the other Fighters mixed with some of the Rogue students
            left us at Grafen. Grafen was not a small town but a large city,
            sitting on the second largest road in Alden, the north-south road.
            This was also the first time we made camp outside of the town for
            the night. The city had it's guards, there was the largest fighters training camp just over the river and the 2nd largest rouge camp not far from here either, with constant patrols along the road, mixed with travelers we were unlikely to run into any beasts even at night time.
          </Otto>
          <Otto>
            The students leaving us here would not venture into the city either
            but went directly to the military camps set up on the opposite side of the river to
            the city. From here, I would walk with other students going to the
            academy. Numbering in the hundreds, after picking up more mages from
            Grafen, and other travelers to the capital, it was the loneliest I
            had felt, it felt like the first time I was alone, even with the few other mages from my village were here it's not like I was close to any of them like with Effi.
          </Otto>
          {/* <p>
            The closest school was the military camp for fighters and rouges,
            they were septate camps by close to each other. There were camps all
            over Alden so students never really had to travel that far unless
            they were like the remainder of us. Either going to Alden's capital
            to learn from the specialist schools of art, finance, dance, etc. Or
            like myself going to Banderedam and joining the magic academy. Alden
            only had one magic academy so students no matter how far would have
            to make their way there. Although the journey to this point had been
            as expected where small beasts where driven off by the numbers or
            guardians the road to Banderedam traveled close to Herkikia and near
            an area often overrun by beasts. It was a rainforest where a few
            major rivers became one and followed into the sea, if it where not
            for the abundance of beasts it is likely this would be the
            location of some major cities.
          </p> */}
          <Otto>
            After walking the road alone for 5 days, I found myself walking next
            to a tall boy with short brown hair. He had the makings of a small
            mustache on his upper lip, a refined pointed nose and a bit of acne
            around his cheeks.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Names Leon, if you care to ask" The tall boy said in a upbeat tone.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>"Oh sorry, was I starring?" I replied a bit embarrassed.</Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Maybe a little, and we have been walking next to each for for 2
            days now." Leon gave a small smile as if the whole thing was a
            little amusing.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "Ah, I am sorry..." I replied embarrassed I had only just bothered to noticed
            him.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "It's fine, you from far? you look tired, must be your first time." He asked.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>"Steinauhau." I responded.</Otto>
          <Leon>
            "...doesn't get much further then that in Alden, you ever been to
            Chingaling land before?" He asked.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "Chingaling? I am going to Tirnavalli Dukedom. Banderedam city." I
            replied confused. I did not know everywhere in Alden, I was only 14
            but I never heard of Chingaling.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Ah, sorry, that's correct, Chingaling is just what us locals call it." He
            apologized in a strange way.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>"Oh okay. Why thought?" I asked. Did he think I would know?</Otto>
          <Leon>Leon stared at me. "You really don't know?"</Leon>
          <Otto>
            "Wouldn't of asked if I did." I replied almost with an eye roll.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Suppose so. Well Chingaling was a country before,
            from Hathapatson in Alden to Dodgud in Herkikia. Alden and Herkikia
            split the country in two and claimed it for their own. Although the
            official story is the people of Banderedam where demon worshipers so
            Alden occupied that area and Herkikia occupied the rest to protect
            the people from Alden. I suppose the truth depends on who you ask."
            He explained.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "So you must be local then?" I asked, since I don't even know the
            towns he mentioned.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Aha, yeah, born in Banderedam. Still live there now with my little
            sister and little brother." He replied happily.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>"Erm your parents?" I added.</Otto>
          {/* Whats he on about, make him come from the capital. */}
          <Leon>
            "They died. Eaten by beasts on a trip like this. From capital city of Alden to Banderedam, there is a section that passes though passes near the beast forest. Risky trip, but pays well. " He explained.
            {/* Work at Banderedam depends on the ports and the academy. So both do poorly in the winter, so trips like this one to the southern towns to make
            trades can be profitable. */}
          </Leon>
          <Otto>"I'm sorry. So you make this trip every year?" I asked.</Otto>
          <Leon>
            "First time. They died last year, my mentor only sent me because this is one of the only 2 times a year when the students travel to or from their schools." He said.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "Makes sense. You can blend in easily because of your age." I replied.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "That is true, but I am no fighter or mage. I am training as a shop keeper,
            I am an apprentice right now." He admitted.
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "doesn't everyone start with one of the three basic classes?" I asked. Apart from a few who have their families inherited classes passed down to them, everyone should have the 3 basic classes upon reaching level 1.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            "Well yeah I'm technically a fighter, but you won't see me fighting even a rat. When I traveled down with a merchant group a mercenary died fighting a giant centipede.
            It ripped his head from his body with it's giant pincers around its
            mouth." Leon described acting out the actions with his hands.
            {/* "Yes, but accidents happen, fights get chaotic.  */}
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            I paused, not sure how to reply to that. Sure people had died from the village, but rarely did you see the monster doing it as a child. I could only compare it to Ilse's death, Effi's older sister. He has a point, but since this trip happens every year they clear out as many monsters as they can near the roads and send adults to guard us. After all even some lesser nobles sent their kids off to the academy this way.
          </Otto>
          <Leon>
            Leon interrupted my thoughts with "you're a mage? where is your
            wand? If you really have no wand you can pick one up in Banderedam,
            being so close to the Mages academy means we often stock those
            kind of things."
          </Leon>
          <Otto>
            "You trying to make me a customer?" I laughed. "I want to get one, I don't really have a weapon, just used sticks until now. I am pretty sure I can't afford one."
          </Otto>
          <p>
            "Yeah, at Pal's shop it seems wands are the most sort after product.
            Maybe it's the books they make you all read brainwashing you into
            buying wands." He joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, you might be right you know, we all have to read the same
            books to start with." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continued walking through the forest in a long snaking line,
            occasionally talking to each other when I said. "There is a lot of
            noise coming from up ahead." Sure everyone was talking or
            complaining their feet hurt but this was different.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe they are drunk. Sounds like they are play fighting." Leon
            joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We turn to look at each other realising there is no way they are
            play fighting like little kids at a time like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Into the northern trees, if we are lucky we can go around." Leon
            said dashing off to the left.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Won't there just be more beasts in the trees?" I shouted looking
            at his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chance of beasts is still lower then, defiantly beasts." He
            replied moving deeper in.
          </p>
          {/* This really needs to come up when you get to the academy... */}
          <p>
            "But the guards." Before I could finish my sentence I saw a a guard
            cut down a 14 year old girl. From neck through the body and out
            through the opposite side, just above the hip. To far to hear what
            the guard said it looked as if they had turned on the students.
            Following Leon, I ran as fast as I could until they where just
            beyond the sounds of metal, shouts and screams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sitting inside of a ditch with hastily assembled twigs, leaves and
            dirt above his head, I saw Leon looking pale as he tried to slow his
            breathing.
          </p>
          <p>"Welcome to Bilkotgopia." He said as I walked closer.</p>
          <p>
            "That some kind of joke?" I asked confused by his sense of humor.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, sorry, a dark one. Close to the truth through. In Bilkotgopia
            people go missing, it's always blamed on the beasts but strong
            beasts rarely travel across into Alden." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So what is the truth?" I asked, confused by what I just saw, I
            decided to explain what I saw after he had run off.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Maybe a noble took a liking to the girl and she refused and hurt
            him so he had his guard put her in her place." Leon said like it
            normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deciding it was getting now where I said. "Like you said, you are
            not a fighter, but can you guide us to the river? I saw it on the
            map, we should be close right?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Y-Yeah I can. After that we follow the river takes us to
            Banderedam." He said decisively.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The river safe?" I asked offering a hand to pull him out of his
            hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahem.. once we get out of Bilkotgopia it is." He said with an
            awkward smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Let's move, even if it is not beasts and just an upset noble I
            don't want to get caught up in it."
          </p>
          <p>
            Leon nodded and they crawled out. We made our way through the forest
            towards the river, the sounds of battle kept coming from where the
            students were, making me wonder what was going on. We ran until the
            sounds had died out and then just walked. After a while of walking I
            wondered if Leon knew where he was going.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could hear a strange sound coming from the somewhere up ahead.
            "Can you hear. Moaning?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Like an old man waking up." Leon joked.</p>
          <p>
            Pushing apart the branches Leon peered forward. In front of him on
            the ground was a dead student & the upper half of a dead man. The
            dead student was a first year, 14 years old like all the others, the
            same age as myself and Leon. She had light brown hair, slim body and
            face, with a small pointed nose. The half of the man that was left
            had blood seeping out of the cracks between his burnt skin, there
            was no hair on his body and his lower lip was completely removed
            along with his ears. He was currently eating the girls insides
            through her belly tearing at the flesh with his hands of bone and
            burnt rotten flesh, shoveling the meat into his mouth where most of
            it ended up back inside the girl through the gaps in his teeth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leon vomited, loudly. The half-man screamed towards Leon and dragged
            it's self across the ground at surprising speed towards him. Having
            seen Leon vomit, I rushed over to help him. Upon hearing the scream
            and seeing the moving cadaver chasing him down I tried to push my
            mana through my body and out of my hand like I had with the Kappa.
            The rush felt easier this time with all the practice I had had. The
            ball of light shined pale blue, glowing lit up the ground and trees,
            before the ball spiraled forward blinding the beast for a moment
            giving me the chance to free Leon of his short sword. I ran towards
            the beast and kicked dirt up into its eyes and mouth, it flailed
            about and pushed the dirt from its eyes before showing his teeth in
            a growl. Using this time, I ran in a circle to the side of the
            beast before turning on my heel, running straight for the beast
            holding the blade by my side and lunging it into the creatures head.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wondered if there would be another level up or notification, but
            nothing happened. Letting go of the blade and turning to help Leon
            back up I heard a low growl and turned to see the beast was not
            dead and moving about with a sword sticking out from its head. I
            jumped around as the beast made swings from the ground. Grabbing
            hold of Leon's sword again and swinging it smashing the beasts
            head to pieces over and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leaving Leon against a tree to recover himself, and taking serval
            glances at that thing. I started to search the dead girl, finding on
            her some coins, accessories, an ID and a few school supplies and
            food.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Guess she wasn't a rich girl." I said to myself. Grabbing the ID
            'Lea Müller'. "You know her?" I asked Leon showing him the ID, it
            was just a piece of card with her name and information on.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, it's an Alden name. Not a local." He said wiping his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Okay, well we can't carry her so I will take the ID card to the
            town and report shes dead or something. Let's get out of here." I
            said moving past the bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The river was just past were we found the student, the water was
            murky like it was full of old milk mixed in with the water. The
            other students would go around the same river further up stream.
            That would take them past the source of the river and around so they
            would not have to cross the water itself. Since we had run
            downstream we would have to cross the river. "Leon, is the water
            always this color?" I asked looking into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No, not further down, just up here. People say it is because of the
            chalk in the ground that causes it while others say it is the
            beasts living in the river this far up. Either way don't touch
            it." He said with a serious face.
          </p>
          <p>
            We walked along the river bank until we found some dead trees and
            pushed them across the river to make a bridge. Leon went first since
            it was his idea to come this way and walked across the tree while I
            held it still on my side. I say held it still, the tree was really
            thick and long, so it was not like I helped a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Leon got across he held the tree on the opposite side and I
            walked across the tree. I tried to keep low and move quickly. When I
            was almost one third of the way across my leg sunk into the tree and
            I lost my balance and landed on the tree hugging it. Once I realised
            what happened I laughed a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old tree was a little hollow I guess. I tried to pull myself
            back up but my foot was wedged into the hole. Then a pair of
            vertical oval shaped eyes appeared in the river looking up at me. My
            face felt cold and my limbs numb.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea what that thing was looking at me. It sure was no fish
            since the eyes were next to each other like a human. I dragged my
            foot as hard as I could against the tree bark trying to break free.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I struggled the eyes soon moved up out of the murky river. The
            face the eyes belonged to was pale white with patches of pink.
            However it was far from human with oily looking skin and where a
            human has a nose was just droopy sack. The mouth became clearer as
            it moved further up. It's mouth looked like a large creepy smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            I managed to rip my foot through the trunk of the tree and started
            to dash across the tree towards Leon. Leon's face was pale and
            sweaty watching what was happening, I just dashed towards him as
            fast as I could with my arms spread out trying to keep my balance. I
            heard a thud and the tree shake, followed by the sound of the bark
            of the tree ripping. I fell down and clung into the tree as Leon
            shouted "Don't stop just run!" I picked myself up and ran as fast as
            I could along the tree which started to fall behind me and pick up
            Leon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran until the tree start to pull Leon off the ground, I pushed all
            of my power into my legs sprinted to the end of the tree which was
            ever more being pulled into the air on Leon's side and down into the
            river on the other end. I jumped off and onto Leon, we scrabbled
            away from the river bank and looked back. The only thing I saw was
            the half a tree floating down the river and the eyes looking at up
            us slowly sink back down.
          </p>
          <p>"What the hell was that!?" I screamed at Leon.</p>
          <p>
            "I have no idea! I never even heard rumors of something like that
            before." He replied in a flustered tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I really thought I would be eaten like the girl before, except by a
            weird river beast. What the hell is going on around here?" I said
            moving away from the river more.
          </p>
          <p>
            "This part of Alden is next to the beast territory. Maybe more of
            them got through then normal with the soldiers being taken towards
            the republic more and more." He replied following after me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Either way there are defiantly beasts here so are we close to
            Banderdam?" I asked a little frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah. The main road is up ahead now we are past the river it should
            be safe to rejoin the road." He explained.
          </p>
          <p>"What about the guards that attacked the students?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "I mean we should rejoin as normal citizens. The city is busy this
            time of year, although it is coming to an end there should still be
            other people going into the city." Leon suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            And like that we left the dangers of the rainforest behind and
            walked to Banderdam.
