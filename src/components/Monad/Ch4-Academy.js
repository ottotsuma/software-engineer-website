          <h3>Academy</h3>
          <p>
            The academy at first appeared to be a large and quite impressive
            building but I had expected a much wider campus and maybe more then
            one building for all of students and staff to fit in there would be
            a squeeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated inside the rainforest, near Banderedam. With tall tress
            hiding the building from a clear view. As I got closer to the
            building I could see vines growing up the side of the stone work,
            towers with no tops poked out from behind here and there. Overall
            the place seemed a little run down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other students could be seen on mounts like giant ants, frogs,
            plants that slivered across the floor like snakes or drawn in
            carriages behind lizards whose bellies almost dragged along the
            floor as they walked. Their stumpy thick limbs sticking out of the
            sides at almost ninety degree angles. Finally some students simply
            on foot like myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The students who came by carriage or mount were unloading near the
            entrance. There where two large doors left wide open, next to which
            stood people dressed in an assortment of all different colours, most
            in robes but a few in metal armor. Inside of the two doors where you
            would expect there to be stairs or a great hall was two giant stone
            spikes. They resembled claws and reached 30m from the ground to
            their top where they stopped just shy of the roof. Between these
            pillars was a mass of dizzying, swirling purple liquid, a purple I
            knew well, it was the same purple I saw the manastone turn back in
            the village hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I stepped though the portal I could see stretched out before me
            a long white bridge, winged with trees leading to a large palace.
            The door around 30m in height, looked like it was made of gold. With
            towers pointing out from the structure and. The rooves where lined
            and etched in gold. Even the dome which sat above the main gate
            house appeared to be made of gold. The rooves main color was a light
            blue and they where pointed like a castle from fairy tale. I suppose
            this is were the stories got their inspirations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest change of all was that the rainforest that could be seen
            in every direction around Banderedam was gone and replaced by
            towering mountains.

            Upon signing the scroll I felt warm and golden light bathed me. Then
            suddenly a message appeared in front of my eyes. [Title: Back to
            School - Enter the academy, +1 Magic]. I was elated, I had only just
            joined and already my magic was increasing! Why was it called "Back
            to School?" If it is unlocked the first time you come? never mind. I
            quickly loaded my stats.

            "Building: cliff side. Room: 501." A key was place in my hand as I
            was pulled back to reality. Slightly embarrassed by my absent
            mindedness I quickly apologized.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am use to it, all commoners are the same when they first arrive."
            The man behind the makeshift desk said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh, I am, sorry." I followed up with feeling that he made things
            more awkward.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's fine, go find your room, there should be books and uniforms
            inside. Best to learn the rules before you break them." The man
            smiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yes sir, thank you." I bowed deeply before leaving to find my room.
            What a strange start.
          </p>
          {/* <!-- Arrival at the room --> */}
          <p>
            Walking away from the main hall of the academy, were there was
            makeshift desks and staff standing around in the courtyard greeting
            new students. I went west across other smaller bridges then the main
            bridge bringing the students inside. Once I left the main academy I
            found myself moving along a wide street with smaller streets
            shooting off to the sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Markets made of older students and merchants lined the sides of the
            street and the first floor of the buildings. All of the buildings
            were made of a light grey stone unlike the main academy which walls
            where marble white. People here wore either student robes, or casual
            clothing. It was easy enough to spot the second year students, their
            robes where one solid color of red, green, blue or purple etc. The
            merchants would ware no robe but a mix of colors epically bright
            vibrant colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was walking for while before realising I had surely come to the
            end of the large academy in this direction. The stone floor had
            turned to a dirt track. I had a small map and it seemed I was not
            going to be living above the shops and restaurants. I walked just a
            little further and saw the houses of stone had become wooden,
            although still nice. The rooves where pointed and curved at the end
            and looked like how I would imagine a house from Leika would be.
            Leika's were suppose to be famous for living with the environment,
            so I always imagined them living in wooden houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where stone builds stood and alleyways where replaced by small dirt
            trails into the woods. The wooden houses placed in between the trees
            in an almost complete circle leaving only a gap for the entrance. I
            decided for now to stick to the main path. I could hear birds
            singing, which replaced the shouts of the merchants.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wanting to look around some more I climbed one of the trees and
            looked into the distance. The forest was large, and in the distance
            I could see a clearing bigger then the others. It looked like a huge
            wooden palace. There where several buildings inside the walls but I
            was unable to really be able to see any details from this distance.
            I decided to drop down and keep on looking for my assigned room.
          </p>
          <p>
            After awhile I soon found a pathed road again, but rather then the
            neatly placed stones in a straight line I found randomly placed
            rocks between mud leading up the side of a cliff. The cliff had
            dwellings carved out of the rock, I could see windows carved out all
            the way up to about five floors high. Looking back I could see
            across the forest and to the academy. I had come a really long way,
            I hope my classes were not taking place in the main academy or I
            would have to wake up really early everyday! Beyond the academy I
            could not see too much but I could see another cliff side, behind
            which was green forest with the eastern mountain poking out. The
            cliffs on the opposing side, they had red painted pillars and a
            water fall falling between looking between the two cliffs the
            opposing cliff was much more welcoming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cliff side that seemed to match the name of the building I had
            been assigned on the other hand was not perfectly sculpted with
            pillars lining the walls but just the side of a brown cliff. Rocks
            and all. The only features where the previously poorly carved
            windows dotting its face. At least the windows had glass inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking to the door carved into the cliff I checked the sign carved
            into the rock beside the door. Yup, this was the building that
            matched mine. There where a small set of stairs leading up to a
            large metal door placed inside of what could of been a cave
            entrance. The door was so large and heavy looking I doubted I could
            even open it. that any man could open it. So I knocked and waited.
          </p>
          <p>
            A head popped out from a floor level window. "Who is it?" A girls
            voice came from inside and the head looking out responded. "Another
            of the dammed, one of us." With a big smile. The door suddenly
            creaked and a portion of it opened only large enough for a single
            body to pass though. "Welcome home brother." A sinister voice
            sounded out from the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Squeezing though the gap the door had made and into the main hall.
            The hall went deep into the cliff, stretching down further then I
            could see but then again that might just be because it was dark.
            Every now and then there was large stone pillars with cube tops.
            These cubes had holes on every face and inside was a glowing ball,
            these pillars where lining the hall all the way down lighting it a
            little.
          </p>
          <p>
            The room to the right was open and inside was the boy from the
            window. Two girls and another boy. Looking between them I decided I
            should introduce myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am Otto I am looking for my assigned room, the start matches this
            buildings so I thought it was in here." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "That'll be the case, 501? 5th floor, room 1. Ralsan is my name,
            this is Tisiel" A girl waved her hand, she was about the same height
            as me with long curly brown hair. "Shrorlei Crerlass" the other girl
            waved quickly once, she was really short but looked strong. "Finally
            we have Reingard". The final boy waved, his shoulders were wide
            looking more like a warrior then a mage type I had in my mind. "We
            are the next first years staying in this building also." Ralsan
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I see, why are we the 'dammed'?" I replied remembering his words
            before I came inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah that, to be placed all the way out here in this erm abode is
            because you must be poor, have no connections to anyone important
            and no outstanding talent. Nothing personal just how the higher ups
            view us. Not to say all the poor reside here just those with no
            history, backing, connections, long distance cousins in high places.
            Basically people who cannot complain." Ralsan said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahem. That is a really poor introduction. Ignore him. While it is
            true we have no backers that is not why Ralsan was moved here this
            morning." Shrorlei said giving him a glare.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Eh-Heh, does everyone need to know about that?" Ralsan replied
            going red.
          </p>
          <p>
            "When passing though the military camps I had thought they placed
            all students of any standing in the same accommodations." I replied
            a little confused by this strange introduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well yes, but this is not a military camp. And if you take a closer
            look you will find we are all first years. This place is normally
            never used." Ralsan replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hold up, you're not skipping over what you did." Shrorlei
            introjected. "We are not all untalented rejects as Ralsan likes to
            boast. I am half dwarf so the academy are trying to hide me.
            Reingard got into a fight with a noble on the way in. Tisiel's
            parents are ... outspoken individuals." She said looking at Tisiel
            with an I am sorry look. Tisiel just shrugged so it can't be too far
            off the mark. "Ralsan here. Is actually a very talented farmer. He
            was suppose to be staying in the farmers quarters." Shrorlei added.
          </p>
          <p>I had to ask now. "What did you do?"</p>
          <p>
            "Look it is not my fault. The farming teacher I was assigned to. Her
            boobs were huge! I passed out from a nose bleed when I saw her...
            When I came to... I might of called her Miss. Boobies. But her name
            is very similar! It was an honest mistake!" Ralsan said with such
            emotion like he was the one who had been wronged.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So anyone the academy finds embarrassing is put here. Great. Don't
            even know what I did to end up here but nice to meet you all." I
            smiled, best to make the most of it. "If you don't mind I am going
            to put my things in my room, I'll come back."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh before I go what was your teachers real name then?" I asked
            Ralsan.
          </p>
          <p>".... I still don't know. Maybe Hoobies?" He replied.</p>
          <p>
            "You are a lost cause." I said before patting his shoulder and
            walking upstairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hoobies!? You are so dead tomorrow if they don't reassign you."
            Tisiel laughed at Ralsan's ridiculous attempt to remember his
            teachers name as I left the room.
          </p>
          <p>I headed up the stairs to the 5th floor, 1st room.</p>
          <p>
            Inside there was a window, a desk & chair, a bed that would fit a
            man twice my size and a bin. Next to my feet this area was slightly
            lower down then the rest of the room, for about half a meter in in
            diameter, here was a small rack for my shoes and an old plant pot
            with an old umbrella inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            After removing my shoes, I walked over to the bed where 3 uniforms
            are layed out on the bed, a black robe, with a smart looking pair of
            black trousers and t-shirt (school and class emblems etc). The next
            uniform was just a 2nd pair of trousers and t-shirt without any
            markings on. The final uniform was much softer and thinner, with a
            note that read "SLEEP WEAR" on top, maybe to save a first year of
            the embarrassment of turning up to class in pajamas.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the desk where some books. "Academy rules, regulations and
            assessment criteria", "Mages, Magic & Mana The Basics" & "Exemplary
            mages: A History". Along side with a note that said "Read Chapter 1
            of MM&M & Histories before first class." That must be the common
            names for books.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving my belongings and deciding not to change into my new clothes
            yet. I headed back downstairs to see if I could learn more about the
            academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I'll show you about if you like, won't take too long not much in
            here. Then after why don't you go into town with me and buy me
            dinner as tanks." Tisiel teased with a sly smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am not Ralsan I am not that easy. But I might just take you up on
            that." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Let's start the tour! Maybe you will think it is worth the price.
            Some of the halls are dark, but don't worry. I don't bite hard."
            Tisiel Said leading the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped in my tracks. "Pfft I haven't washed since I got here, you
            won't dare." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel took me around as promised, Floors 2 ~ 3 where for girls
            only, including sleeping rooms a shared kitchen on each floor.
            Floors 4 ~ 5 where the same but for boys. The 1st floor was a shared
            common room we met in earlier near the entrance. Bath area for boys
            and girls. Although the separation seemed to be an afterthought and
            was just wooden boards stretched along and splitting in half what
            should of been one bath and changing room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next thing was a library, it was mostly unused and dusty, the
            only books to be found here where either decades old or older
            students books left behind. Walking further down the main hall on
            the first floor we came to a large circular door. There where
            markings all around the door frame, a language I did not know. The
            door was made of four circles. Three outer circles which looked like
            they could rotate independently marked with weird markings, one for
            each. The last was the middle circle, it just had one symbol but did
            not look like it would rotate.
          </p>
          {/* Here */}
          <p>"And this is?" I asked, gesturing to the door.</p>
          <p>"Sex dungeon." Tisiel replied without missing a beat.</p>
          <p>"Aha, you have a strange sense of humor." I laughed.</p>
          <p>
            "Fine you got me. I have no idea what this is either, truth be told,
            not sure anyone does. No one we asked know what it is." She replied.
          </p>
          <p>"Mmm let's just hope it stays shut." I said.</p>
          <p>"Yeah, so how about that dinner?" She replied.</p>
          <p>
            "Sounds good to me, I think you earned it. Know any places?" I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Nowhere special but just past the Leika's area is the restaurants
            that are closest to here, they all seem fine to me. You know the
            place with the normal houses we can't stay in..." She replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Lead the way, I'll pay. I knew those houses were Leikan style. Why
            are they out here? Don't they have their own academy in Alden?" I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ohhh have you not spent the loan yet?" She asked. "Oh a Leikan
            princess came to study Aldenese magic. That's all I really know to
            be honest." She added.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah okay well would be nice to be able to study aboard." I then
            added "I mean. It's not really my money. We were attacked on the way
            here."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Do the Gods not curse those who take from the dead?" She said
            shocked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Can't say I know of any curses but it is not like she will need it
            now." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>"You are going to fit in here. Ahaha." She laughed.</p>
          {/* HEre */}
          <p>
            We went out for dinner in closest street. She also showed me around
            some more, there was more to do closer to the academy, from pubs,
            sports, gambling, dueling, and many other entertainments. The
            notable places around the main academy where the market areas, the
            main of which had a large church near by. The large arena, the
            academy's main library and mission office.
          </p>
          <p>
            After dinner we made their way back to the cliff side dorm. At the
            entrance to the door Tisiel spoke "I am home brother."
          </p>
          <p>To my surprise the door spoke back. "Welcome home sister."</p>
          <p>"What was that?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah, the password. The cliff side dorm is old, no one has explained
            how it works only that it does." She replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well it is good to know how to get in, I was worried someone would
            always have to be inside." I joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went to my room after parting ways to read though the books that
            the note had told me to. The MM&M book was a about mages and how to
            use the basic spells. In short it described them as a class which
            casts spells using mana. The book went on in more detail on the
            spells in each chapter but since I only had to read chapter one I
            picked up the history book after.
