          <h3>Academy</h3>
          <p>
            The academy at first appeared to be a large and quite impressive
            building but I had expected a much wider campus and maybe more then
            one building for all of students and staff to fit in there would be
            a squeeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated inside the rainforest, near Banderedam. With tall tress
            hiding the building from a clear view. As I got closer to the
            building I could see vines growing up the side of the stone work,
            towers with no tops poked out from behind here and there. Overall
            the place seemed a little run down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other students could be seen on mounts like giant ants, frogs,
            plants that slivered across the floor like snakes or drawn in
            carriages behind lizards whose bellies almost dragged along the
            floor as they walked. Their stumpy thick limbs sticking out of the
            sides at almost ninety degree angles. Finally some students simply
            on foot like myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The students who came by carriage or mount were unloading near the
            entrance. There where two large doors left wide open, next to which
            stood people dressed in an assortment of all different colours, most
            in robes but a few in metal armor. Inside of the two doors where you
            would expect there to be stairs or a great hall was two giant stone
            spikes. They resembled claws and reached 30m from the ground to
            their top where they stopped just shy of the roof. Between these
            pillars was a mass of dizzying, swirling purple liquid, a purple I
            knew well, it was the same purple I saw the manastone turn back in
            the village hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I stepped though the portal I could see stretched out before me
            a long white bridge, winged with trees leading to a large palace.
            The door around 30m in height, looked like it was made of gold. With
            towers pointing out from the structure and. The rooves where lined
            and etched in gold. Even the dome which sat above the main gate
            house appeared to be made of gold. The rooves main color was a light
            blue and they where pointed like a castle from fairy tale. I suppose
            this is were the stories got their inspirations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The biggest change of all was that the rainforest that could be seen
            in every direction around Banderedam was gone and replaced by
            towering mountains.

            Upon signing the scroll I felt warm and golden light bathed me. Then
            suddenly a message appeared in front of my eyes. [Title: Back to
            School - Enter the academy, +1 Magic]. I was elated, I had only just
            joined and already my magic was increasing! Why was it called "Back
            to School?" If it is unlocked the first time you come? never mind. I
            quickly loaded my stats.

            "Building: Cliffside. Room: 501 A key is place in my hand as I was
            pulled back to reality. Slightly embarrassed by my outbursts I
            quickly apologized
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            "Yes sir, thank you" I bowed deeply before leaving to find my room.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- Arrival at the room --> */}

          <p>
            Walking away from the main hall of the academy across other bridges
            and though streets, markets made of students and permitted
            merchants. They came with wagons, small shops in the bottom floor of
            housing the floor was layed in marble or stone. People wore either
            robes, with uniform markings but of different colours or bright
            colorful casual clothing. I was walking for while before realising I
            had surely come to the end of the large academy in this direction.
            The stone floor had turned to a dirt track, checking a nearby stone
            building for its housing number and checking it to my own, I walked
            just a little further and saw the houses of stone had become wooden,
            although still nice. The rooves where pointed and curved at the end
            and looked like how I would imagine a house from Leika would be,
            trees stood around and I could hear birds singing. The houses in
            this area where built within or near trees and nature all around,
            the paths where grass which had been walked more often then the
            other areas. Wanting to look around some more I climbed one of the
            trees and looked into the distance, the forest was large, and in the
            distance I could see a very large structure where there was less
            trees, a huge wooden palace. There where several buildings inside
            and a small wall around the outside, unable to really be able to see
            any details from this distance I decided to drop down and keep on
            looking for my assigned room.
          </p>

          <p>
            After awhile I soon found a pathed road again, but rather then the
            neatly placed stones in a straight line I found randomly placed
            rocks between mud leading up the side of a cliff. The cliff had
            dwellings carved out of the rock, it was about 5 floors high.
            Looking back I could see cliffs on the opposing side, they had red
            painted pillars and a water fall falling between and atop them
            eleven dwellings with forests around, looking between the two cliffs
            the opposing cliff was much more welcoming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Walking to the door carved into the cliff I checked the sign carved
            into the rock beside the door. Yup, this was the building that
            matched mine. There where a small set of stairs leading up to a
            large metal door placed inside of a natural looking cave entrance.
            The door was so large and heavy I doubted I could even open, that
            any man could open it. So I knocked and waited.
          </p>

          <p>
            A head popped out from a floor level window. "Who is it?" a girls
            voice came from inside and the head looking out responded "Another
            of the dammed, one of us." with a big smile and the door creaked and
            a portion of it opened only large enough for a single body to pass
            though. "Welcome home brother."
          </p>

          <p>
            Walking inside the main hall was much longer and deeper then I
            thought back into the cliff, a good 1km or so. Not wanting to
            explore around this place too much I noted that there where large
            stone pillars with rounded hat-like tops. Below the 'hats' where
            holes and inside was a glowing ball, these pillars where lining the
            hall all the way down lighting it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pushing the door to my right, and looking inside was the boy from
            the window, two girls and another boy. Looking between them I
            decided I should introduce myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I am Otto I am looking for my assigned room, the start matches this
            buildings so I thought it was in here."
          </p>

          <p>
            "That'll be the case, 501? 5th floor, room 1. Ralsan is my name,
            this is Tisiel" A girl waved her hand, she was about the same height
            as me with long curly brown hair. "Shrorlei Crerlass" the other girl
            waved quickly once, she was really short but looked strong. "Finally
            we have Reingard". The final boy waved, his shoulders were wide
            looking more like a warrior then a mage type I had in my mind. "We
            are the next first years staying in this building also." Ralsan
            said.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "I see, why are we the 'dammed'?"</p>

          <p>
            Ralsan - "Ah that, to be placed all the way out here in this erm
            abode is because you must be poor, have no connections to anyone
            important and no outstanding talent. Nothing personal just how thigh
            higher ups view us, not to say all the poor reside here just those
            with no history, backing, connections, long distance cousins in high
            places. Basically people who cannot complain."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "When passing though the military camps I had thought they
            placed all children of any standing in the same accommodations."
          </p>

          <p>
            Ralsan - "Well yes, but this is not a military camp, and if you take
            a closer look you will find they are not put into the same groups at
            least."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Another might be disappointed, but I look forward to being
            away from the noise of the town during the night at least."
          </p>

          <p>
            Ralsan - "Aha, honestly the rooms are not too bad go up and take a
            look, we will be here."
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Ah thank you, it has been a long way."</p>

          <p>I headed up the stairs to the 5th floor, 1st room.</p>

          {/* <!-- room inside --> */}

          <p>
            Inside there was a window, a desk & chair, a bed that would fit a
            man twice my size and a bin. Next to my feet this area was slightly
            lower down then the rest of the room, for about half a meter in in
            diameter, here was a small rack for my shoes and an old plant pot
            with an old umbrella inside.
          </p>

          <p>
            After removing my shoes, I walked over to the bed where 3 uniforms
            are layed out on the bed, a black robe, with a smart looking pair of
            black trousers and t-shirt (school and class emblems etc). The next
            uniform was just a 2nd pair of trousers and t-shirt without any
            markings on. The final uniform was much softer and thinner, with a
            note that read "SLEEP WEAR" on top, maybe to save a first year of
            the embarrassment of turning up to class in pajamas.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the desk where some books. "Academy rules, regulations and
            assessment criteria", "Mages, Magic & Mana The Basics" & "Exemplary
            mages: A History". Along side with a note that said "Read Chapter 1
            of MM&M & Histories before first class." That must be the common
            names for books.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leaving my belongings and deciding not to change into my new clothes
            yet I headed back downstairs to see if I could learn more about the
            housing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "I'll show you about if you like, won't take too long not
            much out this way, then after why don't you go into town with me and
            buy me dinner as tanks" she teased with a sly smile
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Be careful what you say, I might just take you up on that."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Let's start with the tour, some of the halls are dark, but
            I don't bite hard."
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Pfft I'll keep you at a distance then."</p>

          <p>
            Tisiel took me around, there were shared bath's on each floor.
            Students slept and cooked on floors 2 - 4. On the first floor was a
            library, it was mostly unused and dusty, the only books to be found
            here where either centuries old or older students books left behind.
            Walking further down the main hall on the first floor we came to a
            large circular door. There where markings all around. There where 4
            circles, 3 outer circles had these weird markings around them and
            the middle circle just had one symbol also nothing that I had seen
            before.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "And this is?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Sex dungeon."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Aha, you have a strange sense of humor."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Fine you got me I have no idea what this is either, truth
            be told not sure anyone does. No one we asked know what it is."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Bad decor"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Aha, so how about that dinner?"</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Sounds good to me, I have no plans to cook tonight. Know any
            places?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Nowhere special but just past the Leika's area is the
            restaurants that are closest to here, they all seem fine to me."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Lead the way, I'll pay."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ohhh have you not spent the loan yet?"</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Ah, I mean. It's not really my money. We were attacked on
            the way here."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Do Alden gods not curse those who take from the dead?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Can't say I know of any curses but it is not like she will
            need it now."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "You are going to fit in here. Ahaha."</p>

          <p>
            We went out for dinner in the main town, she showed me around, there
            was more to do closer to the academy, from pubs, sports, gambling,
            dueling, and many other entertainments. The notable places around
            the main academy where the market areas, the main of which had a
            large church near by, the large arena, the academy's main library
            and mission office.
          </p>

          <p>
            After dinner we made their way back to the cliffside dorm. At the
            entrance to the door Tisiel spoke "I am home brother."
          </p>
          <p>To my surprise the door spoke back. "Welcome home sister."</p>
          <p>Otto - "What was that?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ah, the password. The cliffside dorm is old, no one has
            explained how it works only that it does."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Well it is good to know how to get in, I was worried someone
            would always have to be inside."
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to my room after to read though the books that the note had
            told me to. The MM&M book was a about mages and what that means. In
            short it described them as a class which casts spells using mana.
            The book went on in more detail on the spells in each chapter but
            since I only had to read chapter one I picked up the history book.
