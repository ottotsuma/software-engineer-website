          <h4>Savigal</h4>
          <Otto>
            Savigal port was so small, it did not even have a market worth a
            mention. Just ships and merchants. The merchants set their goods up
            on wooden crates or out the back of the wagons, no real stalls, but
            I was hungry and not about to complain. The port had 2 ships in
            dock, a small cog with one sail. The other was a Hatalia ship, a
            balinger with a single mast with many holes for oars. Although the
            sails were closed right now, I could only tell it was from The
            Kingdom of Hatalia because of the flag flown from the rear of the
            ship. It was unlikely they built the ship themselves, The kingdoms's
            navy might be as large as Aldens but they brought their ships from
            Chalbia.
          </Otto>
          <p>
            I made my way through the small market place buying fruits, I always
            had a thing for fruits. I had traveling funds and it' nice to try
            new things. After shopping I went to the office building, normally a
            small town like this would use the village hall for any government
            administration, but since Savigal was a port town capable of being
            used during times of war it had a government office building here.
            All I had to do was take my ID and mission slip in and in return
            they informed the bathhouse. While I waited for the sun go to down,
            since the mission was to take place just after the sun sets, I
            rested in the large tavern.
          </p>

          {/* I could make the trip in 2 days and rest at a town each night so I did not need much, */}
          <p>
            Just after the sun set I made my way to the bath house, waiting for
            me was an elderly woman, hunched over a small cane in her hand she
            smiled and waved towards me. I waved back, my robe must of given me
            away.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Must be the boy they sent from the academy, first year am I right?"
          </p>

          <p>"Yes but how did you know?"</p>

          <p>
            "You robe, pure black. They will give you a new one when you get
            back, thing is it embarrasses the academy if a mage with colours
            dies on their first mission."
          </p>

          <p>"Oh I see.."</p>

          <p>
            "Don't worry the only danger to your mission is making it all the
            way out here, the task of putting up manaballs should be simple
            really. Follow me I just need you to put lightning-manaballs inside
            these stone totems. Should keep those damned things away. What you
            doing back there don't be shy the bathhouse is empty tonight."
          </p>

          <p>"Ah yes sorry, the sign said ladies so.."</p>

          <p>"It's empty get in here."</p>

          <p>"Yes Ma`am."</p>

          <p>
            The task was really short, around the bathing area where stone
            totems about my height, they had sloped tops to keep the rain off,
            under was a hole around the size of my hand. I placed my hand inside
            and created a manaball with lightning infused inside. After putting
            a few lightning-manaballs around the bathhouse and chatting to the
            bathhouse lady for awhile I found out the manaballs I left behind
            kept the mana I expended, so my mana was not regenerating. They
            would fade eventually though the night and that was why I had to
            stay in town until the usual mage returned from their trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned mosquitoes are small bugs that bite you, and it's
            really itchy! The cure however is a 40 degree bath ... This had to
            be the best perk of the job.
          </p>

          <p>
            While relaxing in the bath, I could feel the warmth move into my
            toes, it felt like the warmth was moving into my bones, my muscles
            relaxed and time just seem to pass by...
          </p>

          <p>"AHHHHHHHHH"</p>

          <p>
            "Huh?" I jumped up and grabbed for my warhammer, the cold soon
            gripped by body after leaving the warm waters. As I looked towards
            the scream I noticed it was a girl wrapped in a towel, then I
            quickly remembered I was naked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah you're still in here? I didn't think you'd still be in here oh
            dearie me put a towel around yourself gave the girl a fright" the
            bathhouse woman seemed to be enjoying the mischief she had made. Is
            she so bored as to set me up like this!?
          </p>

          <p>
            After apologizing to the girl, the many other women I ran past on
            the way out, I made my way over to the tavern. Tonight I would drown
            that embarrassment in drink.
          </p>
          {/* Days in the village? - re do*/}
          <p>
            Just as I was getting my first drink the bar tender handed me a
            note, on the front was my name in scribbled hand writing. Inside was
            a badly drawn map with a line from the tavern into the nearby forest
            with a large X on it. "What the hell is this?" I asked no one in
            particular.
          </p>

          <p>"Can't say I understand it, but looked like a map to me."</p>

          <p>"Mmm yeah thanks, who gave it to you?"</p>

          <p>"Bathhouse.."</p>

          <p>"Yeah I'm not going."</p>

          <p>"Isn't she your employer?"</p>

          <p>
            "...It's almost like you don't want my money.. Fine I'm going.."
          </p>

          <p>"Take care of yourself kid, no doubt she's up to no good."</p>

          <p>"...Yeah"</p>

          <p>
            Making my way back into the village, past the bathhouse and up into
            the forest, not too far into the forest was a small house, walking
            up the stairs and knocking on the small door I wanted, soon enough
            the bathhouse women opened the door. "Ah good you got my message"
          </p>

          <p>"Barely it looked like a child's drawing."</p>

          <p>"Well it is, Mia here drew it."</p>

          <p>
            It was the girl from the bathhouse, I could not be more embarrassed.
            "Ah sorry about earlier." I touched the back of my head and tried to
            smile. Mia just looked away with a red face, seems she dose not like
            me. I wouldn't like me either..
          </p>

          <p>"So, why did you call me out here?"</p>
          <p>
            "Ah well I know it's not part of the request I sent to the academy,
            but would you lightning a manaball here also? Just to help out an
            old women, no one wants to be bitten by those nasty thing."
          </p>

          <p>"Yeah alright." I lit up the stone totem from the inside.</p>

          <p>
            "Mia is my granddaughter. Not that you asked, but she is a Mage and
            is going to the academy next year."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'm sure she will enjoy it there and learn much, just write ahead
            in advance and ask not to be put into the cliff side."
          </p>

          <p>"Well of course everyone knows that."</p>

          <p>My eyebrow twitched at the comment..</p>

          <p>
            "What I really was hoping was that you could talk to Mia and tell
            her about the academy it's been so long since I went I am sure it is
            nothing like it was before."
          </p>

          <p>"Ah okay, I guess I can, as a way to say sorry..."</p>

          <p>
            "That's the spirit, I'll get you two some drinks and food, I hope
            you like mangos."
          </p>

          <p>
            This is going to be so awkward. In the end Mia was easy to talk to,
            since we were almost the same age and I had only just joined the
            academy and she was so interested in it we had a lot to talk about.
            I ended up sleeping there for the night. At least I saved the cost
            of a room.
          </p>
          {/* I would head back early in the morning and try to
            make it to Chihal and look around the market by the afternoon. */}
          {/* <p>
            I ended up having to give Mia my address so she could send me mail
            if she had more questions about the academy, when they found out I
            was staying in the cliff side they pitied me a bit, but if I'm
            honest since day one I have enjoyed staying there. I waved good bye
            and set off along the path to Tisiel.
          </p> */}
          <p>
            In the morning I woke gently with the sun on my face. I wonder how
            long I had really slept for, Mia had kept me up quite late I think.
            Maybe just the amount of questions wore me down. Walked around
            quietly after I woke up to see if I could find the bathhouse woman,
            Mrs. Huber. Who insisted I just called her gran.
          </p>
          <p>
            She made me breakfast while catching me up on the small details that
            would not fit on the message she had sent to the academy. The job
            was to light the bathhouse with lightning every night while the
            usual mage was away visiting family. I would be here about a week
            staying with Gran and Mia. During breakfast Gran also told me about
            the town and things I could do during the day time.
          </p>
          {/* Be here for a week while the mage is on holiday visiting her family. */}
          <p>
            Savigal was a port town on the edge of Huonhia now. In the past this
            town use to sit in the middle of Chingaling. It was a small port
            with little reason to become a port at the time. It was right next
            to a large monster territory, not the fastest port to Chihal, the
            closest big city. What made Savigal stand out back then was the
            dungeons located near by.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were dungeons near the source of the river west of Savigal.
            North-west into the jungle, just west of the main road. North-east
            inside a hill and of course the various high level dungeons to the
            south, in the monster territory. The most famous dungeon around
            these parts though is the one in town. The reason for that is
            because it is a very low level dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a level 10 dungeon, although the monsters inside are all level
            10, they vary in difficulty. "Level 10 dungeons only require four
            people to join, it should not be impossible to find three more to
            join you." Gran had said as I finished eating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being a small town, there was no lack of people wanting to
            take on the dungeon. Both old and young. A level 10 dungeon was out
            of reach of most of the students of the town but the teaching staff
            were going in with the oldest of the students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joined in were travelers and other students who had made it out here
            on missions. While most adults were over level 10 dungeons were a
            special place that would reduce a persons level if it were too high.
            Because of this what the students were getting most from this
            co-operation was know-how and information.
          </p>
          <p>
            
          </p>
          {/* 8 ~ 14 */}
          {/* Wandering Zombie,  
Ancient Zombie, Berserk Zombie, Corpse Ranger, Skeleton Soldier, Skeleton Lancer, 
Corpse Sergeant  */}
          {/* Home again */}
          <p>
            On the journey back I saw more guards then usual, maybe because of
            yesterdays attack. I managed to make it back to the market by just
            after midday I really made good timing. In the market I managed to
            find a book with strange markings on it, the same strange markings I
            saw with Tisiel on the door in the cliff side. I knew I had to buy
            it, the merchant only had odd and unique items which all seem to be
            of little or no use other then being odd. In the end I had managed
            to buy the book in exchange some of the coins I had found on the
            foreigner, he seemed much more interested in those then real money.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staying the night again, and heading to Banderedam in the morning
            was my plan. After I was finished at the market however I was
            approached by Giselher who was escorting a merchant group asking if
            I would travel with them to Banderedam tonight. While it was risky
            to travel at night, I would be with the other guards and make some
            more money. I took them up on the offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            That night I walked next to the wagon along with Giselher, he told
            he had been working as a guard for hire for over 10 years since he
            left the military academy. Since the attack yesterday the merchants
            would be hiring more but the chance of attack was less, usually when
            one strong monster is taken down in an area it takes awhile before
            another appears. As if to prove him wrong only 15 minutes after he
            said it we came across some monsters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Skeletons. This better not be Tisiel's doing was all I could think.
            The battle was not to my advantage initially, skeletons had a slight
            natural resistance for lightning. I soon found however they where
            very weak to my warhammer, I soon gave up on using spells on the
            skeletons directly and opted to save my mana to charge, and shock
            them to create an opening.
          </p>

          <p>
            55% damage per swing, swing, shock, swing. Repeating this over and
            over until we had killed 50 skeletons between us. "What level are
            they Giselher?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Around level 10, skeletons are quite common here with the jungle to
            the south and academy to the north. These are mage skeletons they
            came from the north and they are really weak. It's their numbers
            that will take you down."
          </p>

          <p>"Anything good drop?"</p>

          <p>
            "Nah skeletons at level 10, you'll get a few bones.. if you are into
            that kind of thing."
          </p>

          <p>"Well, I have a friend who might be interested..."</p>

          <p>
            "Forgot you are from the academy for a moment, take them they are
            worthless really and I feel wrong being around them."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah yes thank you, honestly I can't say I want to hold onto them for
            too long."
          </p>

          <h4>Banderedam Part 2</h4>
          {/* <!-- Town - Talk to Leon and his sister, who gives Otto the mask he found in the forest. --> */}
          <p>
            After we made it to Banderedam I thanked Giselher, got paid and
            headed to the shop Leon worked at. Just as he said he was now an
            apprentice shop keeper, he was behind a counter thinking about
            something hard while looking down at some papers and a large book. I
            walked up to him and knocked on the desk "Shouldn't the shop keeper
            greet the costumers?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I am so sorry si...Hey you came!" Leon wore a bright smile but the
            frown lines still remained on his forehead, whatever was troubling
            him had not left his mind.
          </p>

          <p>"You working hard? You seem a little stressed."</p>

          <p>
            "Ahaha no no, just learning to keep the books all this math's hurts
            my brain. I am enjoying it really its a good challenge. So they
            finally let you out of the academy? Why don't you stay for dinner?
            My sister is a really good cook!"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'll take you up on that, but I'll buy the ingredients I just got
            paid and you have work to do. I'll come back with supplies and you
            can show me the way to your house."
          </p>

          <p>"Ah really? That sounds like a plan!"</p>

          <p>
            As agreed I went shopping for fresh vegetables and meat, I did just
            get paid and if I took any money back to the academy with me they
            would take it as I owed them a debt. It's not like I could spend all
            of the money though, they sent me on a mission and knew how much I
            would be paid for that at least. Arriving back at the shop I had
            left a over an hour ago Leon was still inside, it seemed that
            clocking off even at after sundown was a favor to the shop keeper he
            owed. We walked and talked as we made our way to Leon's place, while
            it was inside the walls of Banderedam it was not near the market but
            across the other side of town in what appeared to be where the
            working class of the city lived. The houses were not run down and
            decrypted but there where children out playing, the streets where
            even clean. I decided it best not ask I might come off as rude
            assuming it would be dirty and run down. Once we made it to a three
            story building and walked up to the 3rd floor, inside was Leon's
            sister. Mouse brown hair like her brother but longer, she was
            smaller and had a lot less facial hair. Her cheeks still contained a
            bit of baby fat it seems, but there was no doubt who was in charge.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You said you would be home late, I haven't started dinner and you
            bring home a stranger?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Relax Milly this is Otto, I told you about him he saved my life
            coming back through the forest, he brought food and I was hoping you
            would be able to cook..."
          </p>

          <p>"And what will you two be doing while I'm cooking!?"</p>

          <p>"I err.. But he's our guest."</p>

          <p>
            "Nice to meet you Milly I am Otto, I'll help you cook, It's not my
            first time and Leon can clean up." I said as soft as I could.

            Leon looked towards me puzzled but Milly just agreed, it seemed she
            had grown quickly with her parents only dying the year before I
            think it was. The food was good and I managed to catch up with Leon
            & Milly was good company too. I told him of the academy and my
            mission, the strange place that was Savigal. Leon told me of the
            strange items customers often brought in, apparently more so now
            then ever.

            "Ah I had been meaning to thank you more for helping me get back
            home alive, I didn't really have anything to give at the time, but
            recently I traveled through the forest guiding a Huonhia traveler
            and came across this." Leon placed a bone white mask on my lap, it
            had large stag like antlers sticking out of the top but it looked to
            all be on piece no joins or breaks and all of it bone white, when I
            touched it, it felt like the bones I had received from the
            skeletons, but somehow harder. The mask had two eye holes and
            stopped just short of where your mouth would be, on the forehead was
            a red symbol. It was not one I knew.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah truth be told, I am not too sure what it does, I showed it to my
            master but he said to keep it it was not something he could sell,
            it's not a mana item he said. Apparently it is from Leika apart of
            their old religion."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I can't say I know anything about it either, but I know just who to
            ask, thank you Leon it might not be worth money but it really
            interests me. Thank you."
          </p>

          <p>
            Milly - "Just glad you accepted it really, that thing has been
            creeping me out the whole time it was here, like it was going to
            come to life or something."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ahahaha she's just exaggerating if it was a cursed item the faith
            would of come by now."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'm sure it's not cursed, everyone knows cursed items are rare,
            thank you again Leon"
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon after I headed back to the academy, it was nice to see they
            where doing well but I really had to get to sleep in my own bed.

          <p>
            Almost as if she had been waiting for me Tisiel opened the door to
            the cliff side before I even managed to speak the password.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Glad to see you are not dead, come in I found things on my trip."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Nice to see you survived too." Coming inside I saw Reingard who
            waved to me as I came in, he was sorting though some bones of some
            kind of animal.
          </p>

          <p>"Didn't take you for a necromancer Reingard."</p>

          <p>
            "Tisiel's bones, not mine, just really hate how she leaves them all
            in a pile, I had to put them in some kind of order."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, well. You're really gonna hate this..." I placed a bag full of
            bones down next to him.
          </p>

          <p>"Tisiel you brought back bones for me?"</p>

          <p>
            "Skeleton bones, level 10. They attacked us on the way back to
            Banderedam, I was going to ask if they where your doing."
          </p>

          <p>
            "No no, I didn't have any bones like this before so it was not me.
            Sounds like there is another mage at the academy going the same
            route as me, but they must be a second year I don't have the mana
            for all these."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well there was close to 50 of them, I don't remember all too well,
            I am quite tired but these where the only thing they dropped before
            disappearing."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh I also got you something, hold on it's in my room I'll go get
            it!"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah take these with you, bag of strange coins with strange marks on
            them, thought it was more your area of expertise then mine. Also
            this." I reached into my bag I kept at my side and handed over the
            book I had brought in the market 2 days ago. Her eye's lit up.
            Without a word Tisiel bowed lightly and ran straight to her room.
          </p>

          <p>"A book? she's going to be gone for days now."</p>

          <p>"You two grew close."</p>

          <p>"Ah yeah, I mean we did share our first mission together."</p>

          <p>
            "I'm glad, keep her safe Reingard, and I'm sure she will keep you
            happy."
          </p>

          <p>"What's that mean?"</p>

          <p>"Here!"</p>

          <p>
            Before I could reply to Reingard Tisiel in some kind of inhuman
            speed had made it back panting and out of breath holding a pair of
            boots up to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You didn't have to run, and thank you." I picked the boots of her
            hands and they felt soft. The bottom felt spongy like damp moss
            without the wet feeling.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah because you have a lightning element I thought you should have
            absorption boots! My parents make them, they are not very popular
            but maybe if you become famous they will be!"
          </p>

          <p>"Ah thank you, what do they do?"</p>

          <p>
            "Ohh, they absorb a small amount of energy and release it to help
            you bounce! The idea was that you could move around in melee easier
            but the problem was the requirement is that you are a mage."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I will have to try them out in the morning, thank you Tisiel." I
            gave a light bow. "But I really have to sleep, sorry to be rude but
            it's been a long night." I left them to their studies? It matters
            not what they are doing and headed to my room.

          {/* <!-- Get invited to dinner --> */}
          <p>
            Arriving back in my room on my bed was a new robe and letter on top
            with my name written atop, and the image of a stag as the water
            mark. Putting the letter to one side I held the robe up to get a
            look. It was black like the pervious robe but with mustard yellow
            trimming around the cuffs and hem. Truly not the best color. Opening
            the letter, it was an invite to the student staff dinner
            congratulations to the first years on officially making it a part of
            the academy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only thing I wanted right now was sleep. Pushing all of this
            onto the desk removing my old robe, traveled clothes, before I could
            even think to do anything else I felt as if the bed was sucking me
            in and off to sleep, I feel onto the bed and asleep before I could
            think of anything else.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next morning I donned my new robe, the color of the yellow was
            not any better then it had been when I was almost asleep.
