          <p>
            No sooner had I made it back inside of the cliff side I was ambushed
            by Tisiel and Reingard. The excitement on their faces left me
            feeling excited too I could not help but give a smile from ear to
            ear. Am I getting addicted to plundering the resting places of the
            dead? Something like this should horrify me.. What would my family
            think. Shaking of the cob-web like feeling of the ethics behind it I
            had to ask what they had found out this time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel had told me she had found the location of another tomb,
            unlike the last times this tomb was not near the academy, or even
            above ground. While the cliff side study was underground the
            entrance was very visible if it had not been for the restrictions
            placed on the door and the genal acceptance that the cliff side was
            nothing worth thinking about another mage would of surely broken in
            before us.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tomb was located over 300km away from the academy, this would
            not be a short sally out into the forest but a long expedition. We
            would need to sign out of the academy to do something like this, if
            we just up and leave without saying anything the academy might
            follow us and if they discover the tomb for themselves they might
            take all of the treasure as they have with the pyramid even banning
            us from going by saying it was dangerous. Well, Shrorlei had died
            but there was always danger involved when taking from the dead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard put forward a plan, one I was not to keen on but if it
            worked then we might just get back without pulling too much
            attention to ourselves. After all once might of been luck, but if we
            discover an old tomb twice, people would start asking questions.
          </p>
          {/* Tisiel" Reingard".  */}

          <p>
            In the morning the next day we made our way into the academy,
            Reingard went off to get food and other miscellaneous supplies. I
            made my way into one of the cafe's with Tisiel, we took a table with
            4 chairs and spread out a map across the table.
          </p>

          {/* unique race, lighting resistance, lightning trap */}

          <p>
            We had not been there more then 1 hour before we were approached by
            a group of older students in the 3rd year, they made to block any
            exit routes before asking about our maps, where we were going, what
            had we found. This kind of treatment was obviously taboo and they
            would never behave like this with other students. However we were
            not normal students, we where students in the first year, from the
            cliffs, there was no way we had any backing.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was 5 of them in total, the first to approach us and speak had
            a sly smile across his face, hair pushed back as if he had just run
            both his greasy hands though his hair. Since they where in the 3rd
            year they must be doing their work experience here in the academy.
            At least we could be sure they were not direct combat mages. The
            only reason a mage might stay is to study theory under one of the
            professors.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Look, we know you are the ones who came across that pyramid. You
            should of had us with you then you might of made it back with some
            of those treasures before the academy could lay claim to all of
            them. Tell you what if one of you dies again on this trip we promise
            not to tell the academy, and if you don't die we will even help you
            keep one treasure. How generous is that? Thats 100% more treasure
            then you kept last time. What do you say?"
          </p>

          <p>
            I had to hand it to him, he would be great at selling water to fish.
            The words clearly stated he did not care if we lived or died as long
            as he got his hands on some treasure and made it sound like it was a
            great deal for us. I gave a small passing smile to Tisiel, it seems
            we would have no choice but to bring them with us if we didn't want
            the academy finding out.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before we had a chance to reply, his hand slammed down in the middle
            of the table bringing the attention of everyone in the cafe.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What's it gonna be!?" As he looked between us my eyes flitted over
            to Tisiel, he quickly picked up on this. Tisiel would be hard
            pressed to forgive me for that mistake. Staring at Tisiel he spoke
            slowly. "So you are the brains are you? Figures, this guys has too
            much muscle to be a real mage".
          </p>

          <p>
            As those words left his mouth I could not help but wonder how skinny
            he was under that robe. I was by no means a mountain of muscles,
            even Reingard was larger then I was. However everyone here knew
            muscles would not help in a fight between mages as most mages do not
            put any stat points into strength so their muscles would just be for
            show.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Looks like we have no choice but to welcome you on our
            trip..."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hey don't say it so defeated, this is a good thing for you. We are
            your seniors after all, you are more likely to come out alive with
            us around, you might learn something and if you are really lucky
            maybe you will catch one of our eyes.." The last line came out with
            a creepy drawl.
          </p>

          <p>
            All we could do was sit there as they joined us at the table and we
            told them when and where we were going and what we had found at the
            pyramid, we might of embellished a little when it came to the amount
            treasure found and lied a little about where the treasure was now,
            namely in the hands of some of the professors at the academy.
            Thankfully they believed us thinking that we were so inferior it
            never crossed their minds that we would lie to them, or maybe it
            just lined up with that they thought was already true. Either way,
            to be sure, I had no doubts that we would go "missing" during this
            trip of ours, and after our rooms would be turned over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our discussion continued for another few hours, we agreed that they
            would pick us up and take us to the location of the tomb. We would
            provide them with our understanding of the previous tombs, and act
            as guides, no doubt this meant guinea pigs for the various traps
            there could be found throughout such old tombs. In return they would
            offer us protection, both from the various monsters and the academy
            by providing them academy with the explanation that we were
            occupying them as field hands for their studies. This would actually
            lift the suspicions of the academy members as such group outings
            where not uncommon as a benefit to both parties and would likely
            never venture anywhere too dangerous or be able to find anything
            that would interest or value for the academy to step in.
          </p>

          <p>
            One month later they arrived outside of the cliffs early in the
            morning. The 5 from the cafe and one more who we did not know or
            agree upon. Tisiel & Reingard where up waiting in the living area
            down stairs before I had made it down, since the 3rd years where
            unwilling or unable to get into the cliff side we had a small window
            of time to double check our side of the plan. After all there was no
            way we were really going to agree to what they have suggested in the
            cafe.
          </p>

          <p>
            With fake smiles placed on our faces, inventory full of supplies and
            academy robes on our backs we left to meet with the group waiting
            outside. The awkward greetings over they quickly informed us the new
            guy was given permission to go into the field for his studies and
            could take others with him as help. This way they could pass though
            without raising any suspicions during a time when the academy was
            clamping down on student exploration outside of the academy grounds.
          </p>

          <p>
            The target was a cave entrance far to the north of the academy,
            Tisiel claimed that her sources state the cavern of despair has not
            been discovered this age and would hold the relics and treasures of
            most of the past civilizations. Each civilization to discover the
            cavern have used it as an armory and last line of defense. The
            reason being is once you have control over the cave you can activate
            the ancient sealing and defensive spells, such spells are unheard of
            in modern times and make the cave a perfect safe. Lucky for us, no
            one is currently occupying the cave.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of this leads to the assumption that when each civilization
            discovered the ruins of the others and plundered it for what might
            of been useful the items, texts and anything of real value would of
            been moved into the cave. What was left behind might be of value to
            us in the modern day but to them was not worth as much as what they
            stored away.
          </p>

          <p>
            It took a few days travel the we found our selves far beyond the
            sight of the academy, in a field where the grass grew to the hight
            of a tall man. The blades seem sharp to the touch and would leave
            paper cuts on your bare skin if you where not careful. We were
            harassed by large flying beatles around level 1 ~ 4 ambushing us in
            quick raids. A melee attack was too hard, they where the size of a
            fist up to the size of a skull but moved too quickly so magic worked
            better.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a week of this we found that the grass started to grow shorter
            and we eventually found sand, the academy had taken an interest in
            this sand during its foundation and initial exploration of the land
            around it, the sand contains traces of mana inside, not enough to be
            useful as studies showed but it was still of interest, after a few
            more days we found that the grasslands had been replaced by a desert
            of this sand, with sandstorms raging constantly inflicting small
            damage as we went.
          </p>

          <p>
            After more traveling Tisiel finally shouted over the sound of
            rushing sand, "Should be near by, watch out for places where the
            sand looks like it's sinking in, it's either the cave entrance or a
            sink pit."
          </p>

          <p>
            To be honest, even with the supplies we brought along and knowledge
            of the area from the academy, I would not of predicted just how
            tired everyone had become, by now the party only spoke if they had
            to, the fake faces had fallen away.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was at this point the voice of my God spoke to me, "This land is
            the death lands. You should go back. You are not strong enough to be
            here."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I am not strong enough to run away either, all I can do is pray you
            watch over me as your only follower."
          </p>

          <p>"...Who told you I had no other followers!?"</p>

          <p>
            "Ah, well your temple is abandoned, your people gone and the worship
            of a God of death is ... frowned upon."
          </p>

          <p>
            "No longer abandoned, full of your people now. My people also did
            not worship death at first, no one choses death if they have another
            choice. My people chose death at the end, like those before us. That
            is why there is always temples to death left behind. You should
            know. You also chose their path, you chose me."
          </p>

          <p>
            A long pause filled the air as the group looked around silently for
            the holes in the sand, exhausted and on guard. "So are you going to
            help me out? I will help you out in return."
          </p>

          <p>
            "It's not like I don't need you, it's the only reason I am feeding
            you power. I could set you a task with a high reward... But there
            are rules about what can be done. Let see what I can do. In return,
            later I need more followers, the other Gods of death must have also
            woken and be building their power base."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Deal, any task that helps me get out of this mess would work just
            fine."
          </p>

          <p>
            The sand whipped our faces, Reingard almost fell into a sand trap.
            One of the 3rd years did get his foot stuck in one, lost his boot in
            the process of being dragged out, he had a fat face, bulbous ruddy
            nose and crooked front tooth. Ditwin was his name, an earth mage
            specialising in rocks mostly. During the fights with the beatles in
            the grasslands his abilities produced great rocks the size of a mans
            chest for both defense and offence but in the end achieved very
            little with his poor accuracy.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was Linhart that first found the cave entrance by chance, the
            leader of this group and an adept fire mage from a fire mage family.
            Between all of the 3rd years he was the most capable mage and the
            highest level thanks to his family. He had stumbled into a sand trap
            only to try and blast his way out with fire, lucky for him it was
            the entrance to the cave and not a trap otherwise all he would of
            done was fused the sand together while still inside.
          </p>

          <p>
            We all scrambled into the cave entrance, it was half the height of a
            man at the mouth but once inside and down the entrance slope the
            roof stood at over 30 meters up. What was most surprising was that
            at first I expected to be plunged into complete darkness but the
            rocks inside of the cave gave off a weird ethereal blue glow here
            and there. Wisps of blue light danced across the walls, rushing from
            one side and disappearing just as quickly as it sprang to life.
          </p>

          <p>
            We spend about a day milling around and recouping ourselves, as far
            as we knew this was the only way in or out and we could leave behind
            some of the supplies for the return journey. The plan was to go in
            and map out the ruins as best we could, find anything of interest
            and head back.
          </p>

          <p>
            We went in as expected, Tisiel, Reingard, Myself, followed by
            Ditwin, Gelfrat, Hildebold, Linhart, Nymandus and finally Petsche.
            The reason we were first? Well that was because if there was any
            traps, guess who would be the ones to find out the hard way.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a short walk though the tunnel wide enough to stand only 2 by
            2 we soon exited though to another larger cavern. Before us was a
            giant temple, with columns stretching far into the air but not
            touching the roof, they appeared to be randomly placed coming out of
            the ground with nothing on top. In the middle was a large building
            with an open entrance. All of this was raised into the air on
            several platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before we could reach even the first platform there was a large
            distance between us and it. Clearly this area would be filled with
            traps, death and trickery. However the place felt calm as if the
            atmosphere down here was asleep, undisturbed for a long time, I
            would bet non of the traps here where active, expect if I made such
            a bet it could cost me my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just as we were standing in awe, Ditwin shoved all three of us from
            behind. "Move it. We came for treasures not site seeing." He grunted
            out angrily as if he would even be down here without us. As we
            neared the temple Ditwin shouted out "Hey once we are inside don't
            touch any of the treasures, they might be traps." Gelfrat started to
            snicker next to him as soon as he said this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel, Reingard and Myself just looked at each other, it was not
            their first time searching ruins but it was clearly not ours either.
            Resisting the urgh to speak back, we were the first to step inside.
            Inside was a stone alter in the middle of the room and three doors
            ahead of us with a symbol on each. Around the room with even spacing
            between them was 9 statues, each holding different weapons and
            wearing masks adorned with feathers.
          </p>

          <p>
            They where not like the statues found in the pyramid, made of clay
            and stone. These where made of the same black stone found around the
            cave which gave off a strange lightblue glow across their surfaces
            now and again. On the alter was an indented hand print and some
            writing in the strange symbol's around the hand print in a circle.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Tisiel was attempting to translate what it said Gelfrat walked
            right up to the alter. "It's a hand print you morons it needs a
            hand." Gelfrat said as he proceeded to push his hand into the
            indent. To nobody elses shock this was a mistake, a few spikes
            pushed up into and though Gelfrat's hand and out the other side
            regardless of skin or bones. Blood dripped down the spikes and
            flowed across his hand filling the indent. His screaming filled the
            round hall bouncing off the walls so that we could not even think
            clearly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon as the indent was filled with blood the spikes retracted and he
            was free. He fell to the floor and fainted. "A blood price must be
            paid, willingly or not. That's the translation. A slaves hand would
            be put onto here to give up their blood if no one was willing, you
            can see in the carved pictures around the bottom of the alter people
            cutting their palms and sharing the blood cost." Tisiel chimed in
            almost sounding a little too happy about the translation.
          </p>

          <p>"Why did you not say that sooner!?" Ditwin spat out.</p>

          <p>"He gave me no time." Tisiel replied without a care.</p>

          <p>
            "Earth ball!" Ditwin called mana though his body into his hand in
            the shaped of a ball and fused his earth element within, as soon as
            the rock was formed he shot it towards Tisiel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel tried to dodge out of the way but combat was not her strong
            point and so moved far to slow and a loud 'Thud' noise arrived as
            the rock hit her in the shoulder. She screamed out in pain and
            Reingard ran to her side and shot a frosty look at Ditwin and
            reached for his sword.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Now, now. There is no need for violence. Gelfrat honorably gave up
            his blood so we may enter. No one would believe he was fool enough
            to now know what he was doing, he knew all along. Now put down your
            anger..." Linhart walked though the middle of the two parties that
            had formed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ditwin had the face of a raging storm but did not keep up the
            assault. Tisiel injured stayed in Reingard's arms looking back with
            a cold stare, Reingard did not take his hand off his blade but did
            not move knowing the 3rd years would not side with him he would have
            to hold his tongue for now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon after Hildebold, Nymandus and Petsche filled into the room
            making it quite the squeeze in here with the statues surrounding us.
            "You arguing about which path to take? We could just split up."
            Petsche said as he walked in seeing the small stand off.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Path?" No sooner had Linhart asked a cold wind pushed past us
            without enough force to blow our hair around, turning back all 3
            passageways had opened during our little fight and the smell coming
            from them was like weeks of rotten milk.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Smells worse then Ratboy." Petsche added. Linhart and Hildebold
            started to giggle holding back laughter as Gelfrat stared fixed at
            Petsche, as he was about to say something Ditwin interrupted
            everyone "Smells worse then 1st years more like." Awkward silence
            filled the room again. Nymandus never said a word just pinched his
            nose at the smell and looked at the bloody alter and furrowed his
            brows.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Right, Ditwin and Gelfrat go left you two should be able to find
            gold." Linhart gave orders out to each to make groups, before he had
            finished Ditwin and Gelfrat walked off first down the left route
            before they could be stuck with some 1st year. "Reingard, Tisle,
            Hildebold & Petsche go in the middle. Nymandus and myself and Otto
            will go right."
          </p>

          <p>
            As we stepped up to the entrances Tisle whispered to me, "The doors
            are marked easy, medium and hard. Be careful in there." I gave a
            short nod and walked though.
          </p>
          <h4>Vault Tomb</h4>

          <p>
            We walked in single file up some stairs. At the top where bridges
            all leading in different directions and non of the staying still.
            Some moved up and down others left and right as they attached
            themselves to different exits at the other end. The bridges
            sometimes moved slowly and other times jerked suddenly as if to
            throw off whoever was walking on them, this would undoubtedly work
            as the bridges where very narrow.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Really? A dexterity test for mages?" Linhart seemed to recognize
            this arrangement as being a test for dexterity, it made sense that
            he might know about these things as his family where landed knights
            in one of the provinces. No doubt his family had access to more
            knowledge and a better understanding of the world then my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            He pulled a small vile filled with green liquid from his cloak,
            drank it all in one and jumped onto a bridge and started running. As
            the bridge below him moved he kept his balance, when it jolted hard
            he seemed to bounce and land back on it. "Dexterity potion, it
            raises your dexterity for a short period of time." Nymandus said
            from behind me as I watched, as I was about to reply the bridge
            suddenly jolted left and then back right, this threw Linhart off and
            he went falling down below.
          </p>

          <p>
            Luckily there was enough bridges that he just landed on another
            further down. Nymandus just let out a small sigh and turned to me,
            pushed his hands out palm up and said some strange words, I felt
            myself become lighter and more agile. "What was that?" I asked.
            "Blessing of my God, we should have higher dexterity now, let's try
            to get across" he replied while casting the same blessing onto
            himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Wish me luck." I said to myself more then Nymandus and jumped onto
            a passing bridge. I ran along the moving bridge for about 4 paces
            before it jerked violently to the right and I fell. I hit my
            shoulder on the bridge below and rolled off to the side landing on
            another further down. Linhart laughed but then soon paled when he
            saw Nymandus stroll across the bridges with a zig zag walk that let
            him walk across without falling down once. Now we were split up it
            seemed that each of us would face the next trial alone, looking at
            the dark entrance I stepped inside before waiting for the others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside of the entrance was a rounded area with a door at the
            opposite end, a few skeletons and a symbol above the door. While I
            was no good at deciphering I recognize this as the number 5. No
            doubt Nymandus was looking at the number 1 and Linhart the number 3,
            if it matched the amount of entrances we missed by falling down.
            Without Nymandus's blessing though I would of fallen so far I would
            of either died or seen the number 100.
          </p>

          <p>
            The room was quite simple, apart from the door at the far end the
            only thing to note was the large body of water in the middle of the
            room, leaving a small gap around the edge of the room to walk on.
            Just as I was about to step in and walk around his voice whispered
            in my ear.
          </p>

          <p>"Scratches."</p>

          <p>
            For an all powerful God he sure seemed like he was saving his power
            to comminate. But of course I stopped and looked around some more.
            The fuck dose he mean scratches? Did he give me a nickname like a
            cat? Maybe he is playing with a cat up there...
          </p>

          <p>
            I looked across the water and around the edges, I looked at the roof
            the walls, and even the gaps between the water and the walls. I was
            about to give up on this senile old God when I noticed scratch
            marks, they where faint but maybe 3cm long from the gap down into
            the water. Clearly if I tried to walk around something would drag me
            into the water. Did the fall from the bridges damage my brain? We
            are inside a vault or tomb or whatever this place was in the past it
            is a tomb now, of course it wouldn't be as easy as walking around.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kicking a nearby pebble into the water... No reaction. Maybe the
            thing died in there after all this time...
          </p>

          <p>
            I gathered a ball of mana into the palm of my hand, and infused
            lightning into it until it was glowing blue, sparking and ready to
            break apart and threw it into the water. 1, 2, 3, nothing ... Then
            the water started to splash around and kick up waves, the walls got
            soaked and just as suddenly it stopped.
          </p>

          <p>
            So did I electrocute it's body and dispute being dead that caused it
            to move, or did I shock it and it's still alive? So I threw 2 more
            inside.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just as before, waves kicked up the water roiled and suddenly
            stopped. So I threw a few more down. After the 20th or so ball a
            giant writing red monster with tentacles of unknown length, eyes as
            big as my whole body and a head as large as the room burst up from
            the water. It lurched forward stopped by an unknown force keeping it
            from going past a few centimeters outside of the water and opened a
            hole below it, spikes ran along the hole and out from inside came a
            huge roar. Spit and bile sprayed all over also being stopped by the
            unknown force falling onto the floor below and like slop rolled back
            into the water.Then, it spoke. "Stop tickling me! Are you here to
            torment me? I was asleep for so long then awoken by your constant
            tickling!"
          </p>

          <p>"I was just seeing if you where still alive..."</p>

          <p>"Well I am, so be on your way."</p>

          <p>"Are you gonna pull me into the water if I walk past?"</p>

          <p>
            "Well not anymore! If you came down to check if I am still alive you
            must be that monsters apprentice, just get out of here and tell him
            I am alive and doing as he commanded. DO NOT TELL HIM I WAS ASLEEP!"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Alright deal, I'll tell him you where awake and doing a good job
            and you won't drag me down. Would be embarrassing for us both if he
            had to come down and get me out."
          </p>

          <p>"Hmph!" And with that the monster dove back into the water.</p>

          <p>
            Not sure if he was still listening I quickly skipped around the
            edge. True to his word he did not drag me down, as I pushed open the
            door to the other side he flicked his tentacle and splashed water up
            my back... It was as cold as ice, but honestly although I looked
            miffed inside I was just pleased I had not become dinner.
          </p>

          {/* Re do with a lion? */}
          <p>
            As the door closed behind, I made my way up the winding stairs and
            saw the next symbol... of course it stood for the number four.
            Pushing the door open inside were three coffins. I needed no warning
            to know this place was dangerous, I was lucky to get past the last,
            but unless the dead could talk and be tricked ... easily ... then I
            don't think this will be easy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The skeletons in this room where too many to count, the floor itself
            seem to be made of the bones of failures. Bite marks accompanied the
            length of each and every bone, death in here would mean becoming
            food. I sat down cross legged and tried to look around as much as I
            could for clues or just an idea. A lot of time passed, I am not sure
            how long but I got bored. I coated myself with the lightning cloak
            and walked onto down the few stairs and onto the floor. I crept
            forward slowly... and could only wonder if they too had fallen
            asleep...
          </p>

          <p>BANG!</p>

          <p>
            One of the coffin lids jolted a little making a small gap between
            the coffin and the lid. A sound was coming from inside, it was
            intense screaming and scraping, the scream sounded like two stones
            where being rubbed together. My ear drums wanted to burst from the
            pain.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ran holding my ears as they bleed out down my cheeks, I almost
            made it to the door at the far side when loud bangs started to come
            from the other coffins, red hand and long arm attached shot out from
            the larger gap being made by the constant banging from inside, the
            end of the hand looked burnt the nails long and black launched at my
            head. I grabbed hold of the door and pulled it open and tried to
            pull it closed behind me as the coffin lid finally fell from the
            coffin onto the floor, the last thing I saw was eyeballs held into a
            rotting skull by over stretched red muscles the eyeball was tinged
            yellow ******
          </p>
          {/* starvation symptoms */}

          {/* Bridge or riddles? */}

          <p>
            The door was marked with 3 lines, while this was one of the symbols,
            it stood for 3 and did not take much to translate. On the other side
            of the door was yet another weird room, there was no floor this time
            just a bottomless black pit with mist rising from below. Across
            which was an old wood and rope bridge which swang in the .... lack
            of wind. Sitting at the foot of the bridge was Linhart. He gave me a
            quick look over his shoulder before saying. "So the stairs outside
            lead down to the other entrances?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah. Best not to go backwards though. What's with this bridge? Is
            there another monster that pulls you off?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Another? Hmm not quite, there is some kind of ghost in the middle
            that pushes you off if you cannot answer his riddle."
          </p>

          <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

          <p>"... I have my methods."</p>

          <p>"Okay. What was the riddle?"</p>

          <p>"What is black and white and red all over?"</p>

          <p>
            Some part of me just wanted to laugh. "That's it? What's the trick?"
          </p>

          <p>"Confident? You are welcome to go first."</p>

          <p>"Hmmm what was your first answer?"</p>

          <p>"... Angry badger."</p>

          <p>
            Keeping the best straight face I could. "Well you are not wrong..."
          </p>

          <p>"Trust me, it was wrong."</p>

          <p>
            I almost lost myself laughing, this guy was the leader of the group
            that joined ours, if they where all like this guy I feel like none
            of them will make it into the inner tomb alive. I strode forward and
            onto the bridge and started making my way to the middle. "You got a
            death wish!?" Linhart shouted from behind me. The mist coming from
            below gathered into a figure in the middle of the bridge to block my
            path.
          </p>

          <p>
            "To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be
            removed from the bridge into the pit blow. What is black and white
            and red all over?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "A newspaper." I replied casually. The ghost gave a short nod and
            dispersed back into mist surrounding the bridge. I turned to see
            Linhart gaping at me. "How did you know the answer? Newspapers
            aren't even red!" He shouted across from where he sat.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Read as in reading not red as in the colour." With that short reply
            I turned and finished crossing the bridge. "You know the answer now
            so you might as well come over." I shouted across to Linhart. With a
            red face and some hesitation he stepped onto the bridge and again
            the ghost formed in the middle.
          </p>

          <p>
            "To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be
            removed from the bridge into the pit blow. The more of this there
            is, the less you see. What is it?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Linhart blanked. The look on his face of panic and deep thought. The
            answer again was obvious, was this just to keep children out? What
            was even the purpose of this riddle ghost? "Hurry up already." I
            shouted across.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I don't know the answer the riddle has changed you bastard!"
            Linhart shouted back to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That is incorrect." With out any hint of emotion the ghost
            dissipated back into mist and Linhart was flung off the bridge and
            shot into the dark pit blow with a look of despair and anger on his
            face, screaming the whole way down.
          </p>

          <p>
            On reflection I guess the ghost takes your first reply as your
            answer. Still was it so hard? Maybe it was, maybe because my dad
            told me childish riddles everyday I find this kind of thing easy.
            With a shrug I walked though the door and up the stairs to the door
            marked with two.
