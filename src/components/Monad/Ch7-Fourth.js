          <p>
            The class was split for the fourth day into elemental groups. On
            normal weeks this would just be one class so the students could
            learn directly from someone who picked the same element as them.
            From level 50 onwards mages could pick two elements but for the most
            part the instructors of this class where previous graduates working
            under professors at the academy. The instructor for the lightning
            class was Edgar, a man in his 30's. While not one for combat has
            been studying at the academy since he was 14, at level 40 his level
            was quite average, most non-combat would be between level 30 and 50,
            while he was not a direct combat class his studies into elements and
            time at the academy helped him. Combat classes would range from 30
            all the way up to 80! Depending on their experience.

            "Today we will be looking at the different types of lightning, as
            some of have seen different mages have different color lightning.
            This is the easiest way to distinguish between types. The basic
            colours are Yellow, Orange, Purple and White in that order. There
            are other colours as I am sure you are aware and they will fall
            somewhere along this scale. For example pink & green color
            represents the inclusion of moisture, snow or dust. So some common
            green lighting is those who have earth or water or nature elements
            in high concentration inside of their mana."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Red is quite rare also as it's a mix of lightning and rare fire
            elements. Although there are exceptions these are just a rouge guide
            line. What I would have you do this lesson is learn from each others
            and my own lightning colours. Make notes on the color, and what kind
            of mana concentrate the lighting is made of. Finally make note of
            what effects this produces, I expect finding yellow, orange and some
            other colours will be quite easy as for purple it is rare but I am
            told we have a student this year from the illustrious Elzach house,
            may I offer you congratulations you will surely become an arch-mage
            at least." Edgar looked to the back of the auditorium sitting at the
            back was a tall boy with stylish blonde hair, deep blue eyes, strong
            jaw and a large nose. This was Vasso of house Elzach.
          </p>

          <p>
            "As for white lightning, black and platinum you will not be able to
            see them today, or perhaps ever in your life times. We will speak
            briefly about them at the end of the lesson but since they are so
            rare it is not something you will need to consider."
          </p>

          <p>
            The class soon erupted into an organization frenzy as students took
            notes on each others lightning. From a light gold, deep red, sea
            blue, snot green and of course ultra-violet purple (紫气东来).
            Although it was a bright purple it seemed almost misty, like
            something was hidden, as if you could push the mist and away and the
            color below would be even more shocking.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most common colours where blue, yellow, green and red. There
            where more colours like orange, brown, gold, silver. This simple
            list alone does not really describe the rainbow like array of
            colours, with shades, mixes and different combinations of patterns.
            While there was one student silver there was two with gold
            lightning, they where twins. Otto's lightning was a deep blue that
            got lighter towards the edges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon the students realised that although the original list of basic
            colours contained four, the level between them was not a small gap,
            nor was the the color not being apart of the list an indication that
            it was weak. It was just that yellow, orange and purple contained
            very few elements or impurities, these referer to the purest forms
            of lightning not the most powerful or useful.
          </p>

          <p>
            One student named Oliver had seaweed green lighting, his dad wish a
            fisher from Jamlesnur and his mother was the towns light mage. His
            mother had the fire element and his farther water, his lightning
            color seem to come from the sea green, with a weak fire elements and
            his own lightning. There was a little proof any of it was passed on,
            usually the place you trained in or what you took inspiration from
            had a more pronounced effect, but in this case it was clear his
            parents had effected the make up of his mana.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the lesson was coming to an end Edgar brought the class back
            together for one final lecture. "Since Vasso is here I won't spend
            too long explaining the purple and white lightning in great detail,
            no doubt you will find out enough over your next 2 years here. As
            you might of noticed the list I gave you at the start contains only
            four of the many colours. These are the primary colours for
            lightning and are in order of raw power not usefulness or
            efficiency, as you might of noticed some of your lightning gives a
            higher damage output then others with even the same colour or maybe
            a lower mana cost. The primary colours are the lightning we know of
            with only one type of element of mana inside. As for the colour
            purple is the closest known to heavenly lightning that human can
            use, white is heavenly lightning but no human has ever been recorded
            using it we only know if it by observing the natural world. Lastly
            for those who asked about black lightning it is known as hell
            lightning and was only recorded in ancient tombs and old records
            before our time."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Don't forget you have more rounds of combat tomorrow, Class
            dismissed."
          </p>

          <p>
            As the class ended the majority of the students crowded around Vasso
            to ask about his house, lightning, or just to win favour for those
            who knew what being apart of house Elzach meant. Otto made his way
            out of the class without anyone paying him any attention, his
            lightning was blue and although it was unlike the other blues in the
            class it was likely because he was from a different place, and there
            where many blues. The first thing he did was make his way back to
            the cliffside.
          </p>

          <p>
            On his way back he stopped when the road had turned from stone to
            dirt beneath his feet. There had been wooden lanterns with paper
            screens erected from the path deep into the woods, it was not dark
            yet but there was a dim glow been given off in each of the lanterns,
            they where spaced evenly either side of the path.
          </p>

          <p>Otto POV</p>

          <p>
            "Well it is only afternoon I have time to spare..." I said to
            myself. Walking down the path I soon heard sounds of people sparing,
            nothing unusual considering first years are undergoing combat
            classes right now. The path split into new paths, the main route
            being lined with wooden lanterns standing from the ground, the side
            paths being lined with paper lanterns hanging from trees. Taking a
            peek down each path led to small groups of 1 ~ 3 floor houses with
            students near by sparing. Soon the main path broke open to a market
            area, food stalls, potions, scrolls, everyday items and consumable
            equipment. None of the other student areas had a small market place,
            the cliff side never would be even the manors that could be found to
            the east high up did not have a market near them, every student and
            even staff would make their way into the academy proper to buy
            magical items, consumables or even to visit good restaurants.
          </p>

          <p>
            The signs where all unreadable, the writing looked like shapes of
            things at times and others looked like letters from a place very far
            away. Ignoring that I took a stroll around the market place. It was
            quite noisy considering it's small size and even though we were all
            students at the academy (or entourage of a well of family) I felt
            like I stuck out.
          </p>

          <p>
            One old man shouted out to me as I passed another wooden hut. "If
            you have come to try Lakian food, ramen is the best place to start,
            come on in." I am hungry I didn't eat during class, so I took him up
            on his offer and nodded and sat on one of the tall stools by the
            bar. "Is there a menu?" I asked. "Don't worry about that, I'll just
            make you one, I don't know the Alden words for them anyway."
          </p>

          <p>
            Later he placed a bowel of pork meat, noodles and some ingredients I
            also did not know the names of in front of me. It was delicious, I
            would have to come back to this little market again, but I had to
            ask. "So why is there a little market out here?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that, Lakia has it's own customs, food and culture. It's not
            that we did not come to not try the Alden food and culture just
            sometimes you want a little taste of home you know? Not all of us
            came here to go to school, some like me where brought here as
            retainers."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, I'll have to stop by more often, I might not be in Lakia but
            if I can eat more food like this, that is not an opportunity I am
            willing to turn down." I laughed and went to head off back to the
            cliff side.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back at the cliffside in the shared living area Tisiel. "Hey, you
            finally taking a break from deciphering?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah yeah, combat is not really my thing but today's classes I had to
            go."
          </p>

          <p>"What's your element? I never asked."</p>

          <p>
            "Death." She giggled, "Don't worry I cannot cause death with it, it
            is more like I manipulate the energy of the dead. Think zombies and
            skeletons."
          </p>

          <p>"So you can take the undead with you in a match!?"</p>

          <p>
            "Aha, no this early on I cannot do anything like controlling a full
            undead, so I can only use basic mage spells..."
          </p>

          <p>"Ah...So you match...?"</p>

          <p>
            "Against another with similar handicap. I still lost, I am not
            really one for combat. However I am making progress in deciphering,
            the wand and this ring are the key to opening the door some how."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well glad to know you are making progress but you should sleep some
            times... I am going to bed now... are you waiting for someone?"
          </p>

          <p>"What.. no? Just got bored of my room is all ..."</p>

          <p>With that I took my leave and went to bed.</p>
