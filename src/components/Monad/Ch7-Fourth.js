            The class was split for the fourth day into elemental groups.
            Normally this would just be one class in a day but for the first one
            it would last all day. This class was so the students could learn
            directly from someone who had the same element as them. The
            instructors of this class were previous graduates working under
            professors at the academy. The instructor for the lightning class
            was Edgar, a man in his 30's. While not one for combat he had been
            studying at the academy since he was 14, at level 40 his level was
            quite average, most non-combat would be between level 30 and 50.

            "Today we will be looking at the different types of lightning. As
            some of have seen different mages have different color lightning.
            The basic colours are Yellow, Orange, Purple and White in that
            order. There are other colours as I am sure you are aware and they
            will fall somewhere along this scale. For example pink & green color
            lightning represents the inclusion of moisture, snow or dust. So
            some common green lighting is those who have earth or water or
            nature elements in high concentration inside of their mana." Edgar
            said starting the class introduction. Behind him on the board was a
            diagram.

            "Red is quite rare, as it's a mix of lightning and rare fire
            elements. Although there are exceptions this is just a rouge guide
            line. What I would have you do this lesson is learn from each others
            and my own lightning colours. Make notes on the color, and what kind
            of mana concentrate the lighting is made of, you can do this with
            the mana-stones you used when you where first tested, there are some
            on my desk. Finally make note of what effects this produces, I
            expect finding yellow, orange and some other colours will be quite
            easy as for purple it is rare but I am told we have a student this
            year from the illustrious Elzach house, may I offer you
            congratulations you will surely become an arch-mage at least." Edgar
            looked to the back of the auditorium sitting at the back was a tall
            boy with stylish blonde hair, deep blue eyes, strong jaw and a large
            nose. This was Vasso of house Elzach.
          </p>

          <p>
            "As for white lightning, black and platinum you will not be able to
            see them today, or perhaps ever in your life times. We will speak
            briefly about them at the end of the lesson but since they are so
            rare it is not something you will need to consider." Edgar said
            ending the introduction to the class.
          </p>

          <p>
            The class soon erupted into an organization frenzy as students took
            notes on each others lightning. From a light gold, deep red, sea
            blue, snot green and of course ultra-violet purple (紫气东来) which
            only Vasso had. Although it was a bright purple it seemed almost
            misty, like something was hidden, as if you could push the mist and
            away and the color below would be even more shocking.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most common colours where blue, yellow, green and red. There
            where more colours like orange, brown, gold, silver. This simple
            list alone does not really describe the rainbow like array of
            colours, with shades, mixes and different combinations of patterns.
            There was one student silver lightning and two with gold lightning,
            they where twins. My lightning was a deep blue that got lighter
            towards the edges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon the students realised that although the original list of basic
            colours contained four, the color not being apart of the list was
            not an indication that it was weak. The students tested the power,
            speed, accuracy and cost while hitting the training dummies in the
            room. A red lightning flash sometimes left the dummies burning after
            the strike.
          </p>

          <p>
            One student named Oliver had seaweed green lighting, his dad wish a
            fisher from Jamlesnur and his mother was the towns light mage. His
            mother had the fire element and his farther water, his lightning
            color seem to come from the seas green hue. There was a little proof
            any of it was passed on, by your parents. Usually the place you
            trained in or what you took inspiration from had a more pronounced
            effect. Oliver's lightning would flow easily, land where he wanted
            but the cost was higher then usual giving him a short range.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the lesson was coming to an end Edgar brought the class back
            together for one final lecture. "Since Vasso is here I won't spend
            too long explaining the purple and white lightning, no doubt you
            will find out enough over your next 2 years here. As you might of
            noticed the list I gave you at the start contains only four of the
            many colours. These are the primary colours for lightning and are in
            order of raw power not usefulness or efficiency, as you might of
            noticed some of your lightning gives a higher damage output then
            others with even the same colour or maybe a lower mana cost. The
            primary colours are the lightning we know of with only one type of
            element of mana inside. As for the colour purple is the closest
            known to heavenly lightning that human can use, white is heavenly
            lightning but no human has ever been recorded using it we only know
            if it by observing the natural world. Lastly for those who asked
            about black lightning it is known as hell lightning and was only
            recorded in ancient tombs and old records before our time."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Don't forget you have more rounds of combat tomorrow, Class
            dismissed."
          </p>

          <p>
            As the class ended the majority of the students crowded around Vasso
            to ask about his house, lightning, or just to win favour for those
            who knew what being apart of house Elzach meant. I made my way out
            of the class without anyone paying me any attention, my lightning
            was blue and although it was unlike the other blues in the class it
            was likely because I was from a different place. The first thing I
            did was make my way back to the cliff side.
          </p>

          <p>
            On my way back I stopped when the road had turned from stone to
            dirt beneath my feet. There had been wooden lanterns with paper
            screens erected from the path deep into the woods, it was not dark
            yet but there was a dim glow been given off in each of the lanterns,
            they where spaced evenly either side of the path.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well it is only afternoon I have time to spare..." I said to
            myself. Walking down the path I soon heard sounds of people sparing,
            nothing unusual considering first years are undergoing combat
            classes right now. The path split into new paths, the main route
            being lined with wooden lanterns standing from the ground, the side
            paths being lined with paper lanterns hanging from trees. Taking a
            peek down each path led to small groups of 1 ~ 3 floor houses with
            students near by sparing. Soon the main path broke open to a market
            area, food stalls, potions, scrolls, everyday items and consumable
            equipment. None of the other student areas had a small market place,
            the cliff side never would be even the manors that could be found to
            the east high up did not have a market near them, every student and
            even staff would make their way into the academy proper to buy
            magical items, consumables or even to visit good restaurants.
          </p>

          <p>
            The signs where all unreadable, the writing looked like shapes of
            things at times and others looked like letters from a place very far
            away. Ignoring that I took a stroll around the market place. It was
            quite noisy considering it's small size and even though we were all
            students at the academy (or entourage of a well of family) I felt
            like I stuck out.
          </p>

          <p>
            One old man shouted out to me as I passed another wooden hut. "If
            you have come to try Lakian food, ramen is the best place to start,
            come on in." I am hungry I didn't eat during class, so I took him up
            on his offer and nodded and sat on one of the tall stools by the
            bar. "Is there a menu?" I asked. "Don't worry about that, I'll just
            make you one, I don't know the Alden words for them anyway."
          </p>

          <p>
            Later he placed a bowel of pork meat, noodles and some ingredients I
            also did not know the names of in front of me. It was delicious, I
            would have to come back to this little market again, but I had to
            ask. "So why is there a little market out here?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that, Lakia has it's own customs, food and culture. It's not
            that we did not come to not try the Alden food and culture just
            sometimes you want a little taste of home you know? Not all of us
            came here to go to school, some like me where brought here as
            retainers."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, I'll have to stop by more often, I might not be in Lakia but
            if I can eat more food like this, that is not an opportunity I am
            willing to turn down." I laughed and went to head off back to the
            cliff side.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back at the cliff side in the shared living area Tisiel. "Hey, you
            finally taking a break from deciphering?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah yeah, combat is not really my thing but today's classes I had to
            go."
          </p>

          <p>"What's your element? I never asked."</p>

          <p>
            "Death." She giggled, "Don't worry, it is a common element. You cannot cause death with it, it
            is more like manipulating the energy of the dead. Think zombies and
            skeletons."
          </p>

          <p>"So you can take the undead with you in a match!?"</p>

          <p>
            "Aha, no this early on I cannot do anything like controlling a full
            undead, so I can only use basic mage spells..."
          </p>

          <p>"Ah...So you match...?"</p>

          <p>
            "Against another with similar handicap. I still lost, I am not
            really one for combat. However I am making progress in deciphering,
            the wand and this ring are the key to opening the door some how."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well glad to know you are making progress but you should sleep some
            times... I am going to bed now... are you waiting for someone?"
          </p>

          <p>"What.. no? Just got bored of my room is all ..."</p>

          <p>With that I took my leave and went to bed.</p>
