Using total war general speaches for the speaches 

"By the gods, how dare these peasants dare raise a hand in rebellion? How dare they? What were they thinking, if anything? Were they bored with buggering goats? Well, we'll kill them, and make the goats feel safer."

The enemy may have the Moon People on their side, but we have lovely hats! And those hats will protect us from their fearsome gaze! (If your general has the “mad” trait)

<h4>Shrine Date</h4>
{/* Mask */}

<p>We walked from the restaurants back to the wooded area of the Leikan people and down a quiet path I had never thought to take before. At the bottom was a shrine, a small pond in front of it with a narrow stone crossing though the middle to the shrine. The shine itself was made of wood and looked rather unadorned. </p>

<div class="pop">Shrine<img class="popOut" src="./images/shrine.jpg" height="400px" alt="Shrine"></div>

<p>Once inside we stood side by side and she handed me a coin with a hole though the middle. We both tossed one each into a box in front of us, then we bowed twice and clapped out hands twice and finally bowed. I made a small wish while doing this unsure if we were suppose to wish for anything.</p>

<p>We walked back outside and resumed our conversation. "Oh the witches hat I gave you before, I found out the previous owner was the witch of Alden."</p>

<p>"Oh! That is amazing! Do you need it back then?"</p>
<p>"What no. It was a gift. Just thought you might be interested also. Speaking of, I have another gift."</p>
<p>"Eh? Already? You only just gave me the witches hat! It cannot be anything expensive."</p>
<p>"Relax, it is just something I found in the tomb. Since I left for so long it is only right I bring something back with me." She seemed to agree with that sentiment at least.</p>
<p>I handed over the set of death and wood attribute clothing. With Tisiel gone I would be unable to sell them or even bring them out without the academy sticking their noses in deeper. I was hoping Tisiel could at least make use of them back in Lakia, I don't know why I thought this but since they always lived in the woods I assumed they had a connection to the wood element.</p>
{/* The items had to get past the checkpoints so how? */}
<p>"This. This is death priest clothing from the immortal world. How do you even. From the tomb you just left? Do you know what this is?" She said going higher pitched to the end.</p>
<p>"You know what it is? I found it in the tomb, I have another set of fire. The other 4 sets where lost when I lost my friends."</p>
<p>"Ah yes I suppose you would not know the stories of the immortals are treated as myths by... Mmm. How to say this? There are some people who know that the immortals use to be apart of this world but left. The places they went and built are always inside of portals. Their tombs left for their descendants are a source of wealth and technology or so they use to be until modern times. Their technology is not that far ahead in most places now and in fact behind in a lot of areas. What they considered to be treasures are sometimes not held very highly now. Anyway the point is towards the end of the immortals they split into three factions. Life, death and balance. Are you with me so far?"</p>
<p>"Yeah I am just kind of amazed you know about all this.. It took me and Tisiel a lot of research to find out even less then this."</p>
<p>"You are not the only ones digging up immortal tombs and doing research." She giggled. "Now the three factions all have powerful members who ran everything, ones personal power meant everything to them. These outfits where given to the strongest members of each of those factions. Fire, earth, water, metal and wood were holy elements to them and so the leaders each had a representative element, the last leader being the over all leader of the faction. These outfits where less their battle armor but more like ceremonial armor, but they where still the leaders of the top factions are the end of the world. While not at its peak the materials and craftsman they had access too..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay! So it is something real valuable?" I asked a little taken back by the flood of knowledge she had.</p>
<p>"Ah I was just getting to that part! You see the immortal tomb of life was found in a portal in Utnaulach, about 400 years ago. A town which Lakia is currently in control of. Inside they found a set like this for each of the elements and one final set, after a lot of fighting and exchange of money and land. Alden holds the metal set, Huonhia the water set, Leika the wood set, Hatalia the fire set, Chingaling the earth set, leaving the final set of pure life in Utnaulach at the academy there. What you have given me is too much, but I cannot say no... The sets are used to research the abilities on them, they are worth starting wars over."</p>
{/* Fire, earth, water, metal and wood */}
<p>I could only stare blankly at what she had just told me. I am walking around with items countries would start wars over. I am level 1 right now, the least qualified person in the world to be holding these sets.</p>

<p>"If that is the case then can you send it to your people in Lakia? If I hold onto it maybe it would not be to my benefit in the end." I suggested.</p>
<p>"Of course I can but, it is taking a big research opportunity away from Alden." She replied.</p>
<p>"I already gifted to you. It's too late to give it back." I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You are far too trusting..."</p>
<p>"Maybe you can pay me back in information, you seem to know a lot of things I do not, and I did recently lose Tisiel my source of odd knowledge." I commented</p>
<p>"Ah, sorry maybe this was a bad time for a date, you just lost a friend." She held her head down low and replied softly.</p>

<p>I took out the mask I had gotten from Leon back when I last visited him, we had no clue about what it was or used for but I figured I'd give a shot asking since it looks like a Leikan design. I held it out in two hands and asked, "Do you know what this is? I don't. It was a gift from a friend.."</p>

<p>She looked back at the mask then laughed a little, "You must have an interesting friend to give you a gift like this, it is a shrine mask. We wear them during festivals and special days when we visit the shrines. There are two kinds, ceremonial and godly. Once you have a god you wish to follow, you take the mask to a shine and get it blessed by the god. If the shrine built for that god, the blessing would be better, but it is not necessary. The god will bless the mask, similar to religious jewelry here in Alden."</p>

<p>"Oh, then does this belong to someone already?"</p>

<p>"If it did, it does not now. There is no spirit mark on this mask." She held out a white and red mask, it had the face of a tiger but it was quite cute and would only cover the top half of a face. "This is my mask, if you let your mana feel the mask you can see that my mana is infused with the mask, this is a kind of mark to bind the mask to me."</p>

<p>I passed my mana over the mask and could feel the familiar mana of Tsuma coming from inside the mask. I had to ask. "Would I be able to bind with this mask?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you want? Once bound it would be very difficult to break that connection with the god."</p>

<p>"I can have a connection to more then one God right?"</p>

<p>She gently placed the tiger mask in her hand onto her face, no straps where needed it gently fit into place as if it was made to fit, "If other Alden's heard what you just said they would be very shocked.." She walked towards the shine and I followed mask in hand. "It is not possible to receive the faith spells from more then one God. However.. It is possible to make a connection to more then one God and wear and receive benefits from the items of other Gods.." With a small smile she lead me to the front of the shrine.</p>

{/* Byakko, autumn, west metal, lightning (our book) */}
{/* white stag,  */}
<p>"The stag mask you have represents one of the gods of lightning. The white stag is from one of the local religions, Chingaling I believe. They have a similar religion to us, Alden puts Chingaling, Huonhia and Leika's religions into the same category." Pointing to the white tiger mask she has on her face and says "This mask also represents a God of lightning, Byakko, he is the lord of season of autumn, the west and metal. What is import for us though is that both will be Gods of lightning! Although he will not be your faith God if you have a first connection already."</p>

<p>I could not help but let out a small laugh and smile, seeing that we would be bound in this small way gave me a feeling of butterflies in the pit of my stomach. To make a connection though the mask I had to produce a drop of my blood and place it inside of the mask where the mask would touch my face, place it on the alter inside the shrine and make an ernest attempt to connect to the white stag God. If all went well the god would bless the mask and it would become a magical item, then I could fill the mask with my mana and bind it to myself.</p>

In Hungarian mythology, Hunor and Magor, the founders of the Magyar peoples, chased a white stag in a hunt. The stag lead them into unknown land that they named Scythia. Hunor and Magor populated Scythia with their descendants the Huns and the Magyars. To this day, an important emblem in Hungary is a many-antlered stag with its head turned back over its shoulder.[24]

{/* Shinto 
Deer are considered messengers to the gods in Shinto, especially Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture where a white deer had arrived from Kashima Shrine as its divine messenger. It has become a symbol of the city of Nara. Deer in Itsukushima Shrine, located in Miyajima, Hiroshima, are also sacred as divine messengers. In various parts of Northeast Japan, a deer dance called "Shishi-odori" has been traditionally performed as an annual shinto ritual.[28] */}
<p>I picked up the mask and scanned it with my mana, I was told white stag mask would increase my magic by {0.4 x level} points or something equivalent, if I had a suitable lightning type power then the mask might be blessed with a lightning blessing. Either way the item would be a common item and the description name would be blue.</p>

<li>Head:<font color="blue"> Ceremonial White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

<p>When I scanned my mask what I saw was surprising, it must have something to do with the new class I acquired because the mask was not even close to the expected.</p>

<li>Head:<font color="purple"> Heavenly White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

<p>"You said there were two types of masks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah the second type is not a kind of mask you will be able to get, it is a heavenly mask, this kind of mask there is only one of in the world and contains the will of that God. These masks are held in the main shrine in Otsu the capital city of Leika. Yours should show an increase in magic right?"</p>

<p>"Is that so... Well the magic defiantly increased."</p>

<p>"You have no home right? The lady you told me about said you would be coming to live near us, well why don't you come back to mine tonight? The place is really big because there is a princess staying there so there will be lots of room...." She suggested.</p>
<p>"I mean, I am suppose to go back to the cliffside and check where I have been assigned to, but I guess they will not have done the procedures yet. I will come back with you then if that is okay?" I replied.</p>
<p>"Sure lets go" She said back with a nod.</p>
{/* Sleep with tsuma */}
{/* Go home in the morning */}

<h4>The Morning</h4>
<p>I woke in a soft bed, my arm felt like the blood has been drained from it so I pulled it back towards me and along with it came Tsuma. Can't complain. So I just led in the bed awhile longer the sun slowly creeping up the bed.</p>

<p>A few hours later I was back in class. I had magic class with Lubin in the morning for one hour, a break and then lightning classes for one hour. After that we where suppose to be in our club activities until lunch. After lunch was our normal training. Today being the first day since my class had changed from Mage to Kʼawiil I found there where a few small problems.</p>

<p>For a start the magic classes where about the Mage class. The only parts of the lecture I could use where bits on the human race skills which was in the past the least relevant as I wanted to be a combat mage and not really the party leader. Also the lessons about mana and magic in a more general sense. I could only hope to get though any practical parts of the lessons by using the stress of just coming back as a reason why I could no longer cast manaball. Not sure how long I could keep this up for. Lubin ended the lesson by saying. "Next class we are looking at the stun skill, this is really useful for those of you looking to join the military, security forces, honestly since it is non-lethal it is a really useful skill. I would recommend you to get it but I will not force you I know some of you have your own family builds etc. See you next class."</p>

<p>I thought at first at least I had a lightning element class, so the lightning lessons would still be useful to me. That was true, the lessons where very helpful in understanding the lightning elemental and how to control it. It's just the color of my lightning had changed. Very visibly so. On top of that I had to use the same act from earlier this morning as a reason why I could no longer produce lightning spells I could use only before hand.</p>

<p>I was going to get caught out at some point.</p>

<p>I was suppose to go to a club until lunch time, I wrote down that I would join the martialist club. I assume I could get away with missing one week, or changing clubs. After all I had just been set back to level one, if I went like this it would be too obvious, even if I kept up my on physical body to its peak I would fall behind those with stat points in dexterity, strength and vitality.</p>

<p>I decided to head straight for the canteen, I would use my lunch token to get my lunch now and then take it over to the training areas. They keep monsters near the arena for testing students, there must be a way for me to register to fight some of them. I grabbed bead, a sausage and some cheese for my lunch, then headed to the arena area.</p>

<p>I wondered around the arena, once I got near area they kept monsters in a man stopped me at the door. "Students are suppose to be doing clubs now, I think you are lost. Only teachers can come inside here anyway, it's full of monsters." The man said. I quickly apologized and told him I must of gotten lost and walked away. There goes my master plan.</p>

<p>I walked pasted the strength testing area and decided to check out my ranking, there where some people gathered around it. They where from a body building club. I told them I was just walking past and wanted to check my ranking on the board quickly, they become more interested in me until while looking for my name on the rankings, I could not find it. I don't understand I was rank 4th for this years students, yes only the top 100 where on display unless you searched with your mana inside of the pillar but how could I of lost my place already? I scanned the pillar to find my new ranking, but it told me. "User is not found."</p>

<p>Was it because my class had changed also? My mana had changed? The body builders tried to console me, saying if I keep trying I can get back in to the top 100 again! I could only thank that they misunderstood my reaction.</p>

<p>Before I could leave they insisted on showing me how they train so that I could become stronger in the future. I was expecting them to be lifting weights like some of the military I had seen in the past. There was a boy on the ground doing an impersonation of an ape, hitting his fists into the floor, on his chest and then into a strength testing device. 20!? "What level is this guy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"15, it's a human perk. Ape Mode, increases strength damage with bare fists for a period of time, while decreasing your defences." A student replied. These people where mad. So I walked off while they were watching him.</p>

<p></p>
