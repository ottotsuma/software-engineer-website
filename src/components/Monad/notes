Using total war general speaches for the speaches 

"By the gods, how dare these peasants dare raise a hand in rebellion? How dare they? What were they thinking, if anything? Were they bored with buggering goats? Well, we'll kill them, and make the goats feel safer."

The enemy may have the Moon People on their side, but we have lovely hats! And those hats will protect us from their fearsome gaze! (If your general has the “mad” trait)

<h4>Cranium communion</h4>
<p>pov Tisiel</p>
<!-- Weird skull talking thing - Tisiel -->
<p>After having arrived back in my room from the dinner party I removed the grey satin dress, shoulderless hour-glass shaped to fit my waist, flowing off my hips giving me gliding wings down to my calfs if I walked too quickly. The thought of one day being able to just glide up into the sky with nothing but my foot steps made me feel like a kid again playing at magic, the reality was that using mana was much more exserting then I had imagined in my make believe worlds.</p>

<p>Slipping into my room wear and feeling much more like my self again, with my collections of tombs, bones, nick-nacks and skulls to greet me back into what I enjoyed most, solving the mysteries they presented. Settling down into an old wooden chair by my study table, I always wrap my hands around the curved handle, old habits.</p>

<p>"Well it's not quite as orderly as my study but I approve."</p>

<p>Stopping and looking around the room, I had to pause and wonder if I had gone crazy, perhaps a little drunk.</p>

<p>"Down here"</p>

<p>I shot out of my own skin, jumping up onto the chair. "Who is here!?"</p>

<p>"Down here, I on top of your books."</p>

<p>".... The.. Skull!?" My eyes fixed to the skull on the books, nothing unusual about it really. It did not move, the jaw stayed in placed, no eyes appeared in the sockets. There was a small amount of magical energy given off, it seemed no different from any other magic item.</p>

<p>"Your first time meeting a sealed spirit?"</p>

<p>"....Yes?"</p>

<p>"Ahaha, well you seem like a smart girl, what do you think I am?"</p>

<p>"Did... Someone trap your spirit into this skull? Was it your skull?.."</p>

<p>"Well you are sharp. Yes my spirit was bound to my skull as part of my peoples funeral process. It was not a common process because the materials needed are rather rare, so it is reserved for only those who could afford it. I think the results speak for themselves, I am dead but not gone from this plane."</p>

<p>"Can you still use magic? Can you move? How long have you been dead?"</p>

<p>"I suppose these are normal questions since it is your first time. Very well, I cannot use magic directly I would need a medium to act though or a source of mana which I am attached to. I cannot move. Hmm hard to say really, I continued as I am currently for a few civilizations before being left inside that witches study."</p>

<p>"A few civilizations? Not years? Or centuries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean 5 in total if I include my own. It looks like you have found items from some of them."</p>

<p>"This is a lot to take in.. So the study became your second tomb? What about your first?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Don't think it has escaped me that most of the items here are taken from the tombs of the dead. Trying to raid my tomb? This is my resting place, this skull. My people did not believe that we took anything physical into the next life."</p>

<p>"I could tell you about the location of another tomb if that is what your interest is. The civilization that took over from my own buried their dead in pyramid shaped tombs. First the person who had died, then followed by their servants, guards and what ever else they would be taking to their next life with them."</p>

<p>Unable to resist, I spent the whole night chatting to a skull, well the person bond to the skull. Gwrtheyrn was his name but since it was a bit of a mouthful we agreed to call him Vortigern, not much better but he seemed fussy about what he would be called. I managed to copy down to a rough map of where the tomb should be.</p>

<!-- Arena --> 
<p>Todays lesson started with an announcement, there would be arena team matches, those who where training to be non-combat mages did not need to join. The combat mages where expected to join, it was a good time to be noticed by merchant companies, mercenary groups & most importantly dukes. The first year matches where put on between second year matches which where the main draw of the arena matches. It would still be good to stand out in front of these people if you wanted to work with them in the future.</p>

<p>First things first he would need 3 teams mates. They must all be combat mages & first years. The first person I could think of was Reingard. He was the only other house mate I had talked to before that was a combat mage. Ralsan wanted to become a farmer, Tisiel was not made for combat, she would one day fight though skeleton warriors but no time soon. Shrorlei despite meeting her I have no had time to talk to.</p>

<p>I decided I had to see if Reingard knew anyone else.</p>

<p>"So, you are telling me you have an older brother in the academy, yet you still ended up in the cliffside?"</p>

<p>"I might have an older brother, but that doesn't mean he likes me.Anyway the point is we can recruit other people at the arena."</p>

<p>"I mean, I guess that will work if we see what role they want to be and make a team around that. Speaking of what are you good at?"</p>

<p>"So you asked me to make a team without knowing what I was good at?"</p>

<p>"Guarding. Just wanted to see if you thought it was something else."</p>

<p>"No, I know my strengths, I will be the tank for the party. But what about you Otto?"</p>

<p>"Melee damage, and some support."</p>

<p>That same day we went to the area to pick up some new members.</p>

<h4>Recruitment</h4>
<p>The arena was the same one we went to for the duels, while the arena had be packed back then it was much lighter now, with students standing around chatting and making posters and signs to try and recruit some new members. Reingard suggested we try asking around those trying to find groups also we might find another pair that suits us.</p>

<p>After walking around for an hour or so we came across a couple looking to add two more members to their team. Volker & Raina a couple from Alden who met in the academy. Volker was a fire mage and Raina and water mage. "Reingard."</p>

<p>"Hmmm yes?"</p>

<p>"What... is your element?"</p>

<p>"....You don't know!?"</p>

<p>"Well I mean when I saw you duel before it didn't look like you used any element."</p>

<p>"Oh I see. It's metal. That's maybe why you didn't notice, its not as flashy aha."</p>

<p>"Oh so back during the duel?"</p>

<p>"Ah, metal manaballs, I use to struggle to infuse my mana with my element so there was no huge change in color. I found it much more effective to make a large wide shield rather then a small ball, easier to control and useful as a tank."</p>

<!-- Training. -->
<h4>Training</h4>
<p>In the afternoon we went into the jungles in search of monsters to hunt to hone our skills and try to work together as a team. The first monster we came across was not a monster I would forget anytime soon. The text book describes them as centaurs, with the lower body of a horse and the upper of a man, but only in appearance, the truth was always darker then it first appeared. The body on a man on top was in fact the skin of a human, sometimes whole sometimes patch work from several different bodies, their true form lay under the mess of meat and flesh. What that was would have to wait until after the battle.</p>
<div class="pop">Centaur<img class="popOut" src="./images/centaur.jpg" height="400px" alt="centaur"></div>
<p>Reingard struck first with balls of mana and tanked the centaurs hooves with his shield reinforced in his metal mana. Shooting into action, I charged into the monster with the skill 'Charged Charge' and stuck down with strike (lightning) infused into my warhammer, I had picked up a few tricks on the way. Just like that 10% of its health disappeared.</p>

<p>Volker summoned flames over his hands and threw a great wave of fire, washing over the monster turning the fur on his rear black, the smell of burning fur singed and hung in the air. Raina washed Reingard in water infused mana and the scratches and dirt on his skin seemed to wash away healing him for over 25% of his total health.</p>

<p>Putting on lightning cloak I dove back into the battle, the centaur had a heavy body, large hooves and a short crude spear it swang around and tried to stab with, the trick to the centaur was to keep it from being able to charge. Reingard would block it by staying in its line of sight, I would try to heard the monster into Reingard. Since Volker was doing more damage with his fire this worked out well for us.</p>

<p>When I saw a gap I stuck into its knee on its rear legs, the damned monster kicked me in the chest with its hooves and I went flying. I landed against the ground and slid for a bit, my lightning cloak had shocked him on impact and given Reingard the chance to provoke the monster away from me. A cool liquid flowed over me and my health started to recover from the red.</p>

<p>Soon the monster fell and our first day of training would stop here.The monster had dropped a necklace made of teeth and an eye ball. None of us really wanted them, but we would sell them for money, centaurs cannot be found outside of the academy.</p>

<!-- What was inside of the meat body ?  -->

<p>Reingard - "You took quite the hit."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I don't know how you take so many hits all day long."</p>

<p>"High endurance, and metal element help a lot. Keep safe though your health is low for a melee fighter."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Should I start buying more items? I feel like I must at least be close to paying off the debt I incurred."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a plan. Ah you two where great, Volker your fire was really effective, and Rainas healing waters work better then other healers in our year, maybe better then some second years."</p>

<p>"Ah thank you, the range of our skills is really short however, and our vitality is not much different from squishy Otto's here."</p>

<p>"What a nick name..."</p>

<p>"Well lets go celebrate with what we can buy from these, and tomorrow hunt again until we are well coordinated."</p>

<p>"Cheers!"</p>
<!-- level 14? attack +5 -->
<!-- <p>Days leaning up</p> -->
<p>The next few days went by quickly, each morning Reingard would say good bye to Tisiel, I would stand around as a third wheel, we would meet up with Volker & Raina and head into the jungle of the academy, never venturing too far in.</p>

<p>Quickly reviewing my stats so far I saw that I had no defences, very little health and was still reliant on a melee weapon. On the other hand I had high mana, high magic output, perhaps there was someway I could turn this into a defense. </p>

<p class="stats">

</p>

<p>There is no way I can keep melee attacks from myself currently, but perhaps I could dodge them? Most will be mages and unable to make any meaningful damage with melee attacks during the arena.</p>

<p>I can use the shoes Tisiel gave me more to dodge attacks then to help me move in quickly maybe to strike then use them to get away, but they only work after i've been stuck.</p>

<h4>pov Tisiel</h4>
<p>Sitting and minding his own thoughts Otto looked like he was lost in his own world again, but I had important information to share. "Otto wake up, I've made some headway on the strange symbols."</p>

<p>"I wasn't asleep, but that is good news what did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Right well, it's my belief that it was written by an older civilization"</p>

<p>"Not a previous student? I guess that's something, well done."</p>

<p>"Don't patronize me, I mean we all know we did not build the academy, that is known all over. I mean a civilization that use to be here but not apart of the original academy exactly."</p>

<p>"Come again?"</p>

<p>"So some civilization built the academy, the portal and the writing system found around the academy we often call runes. However these symbol's don't match, not even a little! They are from a later civilization that built on top of the academy, they built the town near by, the smaller academy, this door inside the cliffs, the cliffs as rooms!"</p>

<p>"It's an interesting theory but what was your break though?"</p>

<p>"The book you gave me, it's not from the academy, you found it in a market on our continent. But look at the book, it's not magical, it's not old or rotten at all. How old could it be?"</p>

<p>"But no one uses symbol's even like this, maybe a student sold the book to the merchant, maybe its been in here the whole time."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you found the coins on a dead body on our continent in strange clothes? The symbols on the coins are also strange, but also found throughout this book! And for the biggest reveal..."</p>

<p>"This! There is a map inside the book of an unknown land, that shows on the next page.. A map of the academy. Which was very helpful as you can see there is an area to the left of the main academy building past the nobel area and into the jungle on that side."</p>

<p>"Hmmm, adventure time? I have a few days more then enough time to make the trip, but it is quite deep into the jungle."</p>

<p>"Yes well this time we won't be going alone, call it training for your arena team and we will take Shrorlei with us also, she is very strong."</p>

<p>"Well lets meet up and head off in an hour, we were going to head into the jungle anyway today."</p>

<p>"Let's!"</p>

<h4>Jungle Run</h4>
<p>The group took me though the jungle, deeper in it became hard to find the key locations on the map, the monsters here are often weaker then the other area's this is maybe why the nobles set up there houses around this area. The jungle became thick quickly on this side, the nobles who often left the work of maintaining the woodland to their peasants on our home continent had all but abandoned the idea of doing themselves here. The next landmark we were looking for on the map was a large rock, descriptive I Know, but as far as I can translate these symbol's mean large rock and there is a picture of a rock that looks like the upturned claw.</p>

<p>"You said a large rock."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, it is somewhat big compared to other rocks."</p>

<p>"The other landmarks where at least 3 times the height of a man, this is. Well it's not small but it's no taller then me, how were we suppose to find this in the jungle? The damn trees are taller, this cannot be it."</p>

<p>"Trees? Yes, there are trees." The group looked to me as if I was the one who had gone mad. "No look at the map! There are no trees, no mention of trees. If this rock where in a grassy field you would call it a big rock. But this map is drawn without trees....Why no trees?"</p>

<p>The group made their way the rock pointed, we followed it for a few hours before stopping for lunch. I could not take my mind off the trees. There were no trees. The map maker could not of missed them, even if he overlooked the trees because they where everywhere it would be wrong to call that rock big.</p>

<p>Reingard "Still thinking about the rock? You have that face again like there is something to solve."</p>

<p>"I just, but the rock IS smaller then the trees and no trees are mentioned. It would be weird to note the rock if there were the trees."</p>

<p>Reingard - "Perhaps the book is older then you thought?"</p>

<p>Bitting down on my lip "I suppose it could be but it doesn't make sense the book cannot be more then 100 years old. Yet it has a map of the academy with no trees, and was found on the main land. Too many mysteries."</p>

<p>Reingard "Relax a bit, we will find more answers when we arrive."</p>

<p>Nodding, "yeah, you are right. As usual." I smiled at Reingard. It felt awkward to be around the others, I could not be myself with him like this. This time we would be looking for the landmark we came here for, it looked in the drawings stacks of squares stacked on top of each other becoming smaller to the top. Not unlike the pyramids found in Pocotcotcan literature.</p>

<div class="pop">Landmark<img class="popOut" src="./images/inca2.png" height="400px" alt="Pyramid"></div>

<p>It took half of the afternoon for us to find a small stream which took us to the pyramid, in among the trees and vines was a structure of squares slowly becoming smaller until on top stood the entrance way in the shape of a large stone square. Vegetation had grown all over the pyramid which had fallen hidden and unused in the jungle which had grown around it, I felt as this was more evidence to my theory but maybe I am just projecting my theory onto reality.</p>

<p>"Explore or make camp? If we head back now we won't arrive back until late in the night, if we explore we might risk going without making camp." Reingard said.</p>

<p>Shrorlei  - "We could make camp inside the entrance way, we could still retreat if we need to and it would shelter us a little more."</p>

<p>Raina - "That sounds good, we brought food and water but not any camping equipment it would be good to save energy and mana on not having to build extensive shelter."</p>

<p>The group was in agreement and we set up the stairs. It was not long before the complaints rolled in.</p>

<p>Volker - "Carry me."</p>

<p>Raina - "No. Carry me."</p>

<p>Volker - "There are so many stairs!"</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "The moss makes each step like standing on a pile of worms."</p>

<p>Reingard - "Can't we take a break, we have awhile until night fall."</p>

<p>Otto - "47...48....49"</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Do you HAVE to count!?"</p>

<p>As soon as we arrived at the top the group fell down all around the top of the stairs, I stood and stared into the dark entrance, it was a large room inside, there where no lights so I threw out a manaball inside and found that there was only one thing inside the room. A large decagon table like structure inside, made of stone that sloped from the edges into the middle. On each section was a symbol, matching those from before, in the center was a small fist sized hole.</p>

<p>While the others rested I took out my notes and copied down the symbol's and tried to match them to ones I already knew. There was four unknowns, Bone Staff, Skull Staff, two unknowns, Wing and another unknown. I started to look though the book for similar markings.</p>

<!--  Xiquiripat ("Flying Scab") and Cuchumaquic ("Gathered Blood"), who sicken people's blood;
Ahalpuh ("Pus Demon") and Ahalgana ("Jaundice Demon"), who cause people's bodies to swell up;
Chamiabac ("Bone Staff") and Chamiaholom ("Skull Staff"), who turn dead bodies into skeletons;
Ahalmez ("Sweepings Demon") and Ahaltocob ("Stabbing Demon"), who hide in the unswept areas of people's houses and stab them to death;
and Xic ("Wing") and Patan ("Packstrap"), -->

<h4>Volker</h4>
<p>Seeing Tisiel distracted as soon as we arrive I light a manaball and walked around the temple, the walls where carved with scenes of everyday life, farmers, gold smiths, weapon makers & warriors. The scenes flowed one into another where on the back wall was a picture of the temple and a priest holding up an object on display for the masses blow. It suddenly felt as if cold wet eyes where looking at the back of my head.</p>

<p>I infused fire into my manaball, the others stared at me but I was more concerned about the wet eyes that watched my actions. I breathed in. Turning suddenly and looking in the direction of the feeling, on the roof I saw another carving looking down on us.</p>

<p>Something about the carving felt wet. It was a mess of writing of tendrils flopping and falling over each other with a pair of black eyes in the middle. They appeared to be staring at me.</p>

<p>Raina - "What is it? That carving is a bit creepy."</p>

<p>"Not sure, I felt like it was watching me."</p>

<p>Reingard - "Sure is creepy. What is it Tisiel?"</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Dunno yet. Their god? Not sure."</p>

<p>We made camp inside the room, and waited for the sun to rise the next morning. We ate the rations we brought along with us non of us wanted to go hunting in the jungle this deep at night. I kept the group warm by burning the wood we had taken from the base of the temple. I could not sleep, not with that thing watching us.</p>

<h4>Pov Otto</h4>
<p>Volker could not stop glancing at the marking on the roof, after awhile Volker took off into the jungle while the others slept and I was on watch. Maybe I should of stopped him.</p>

<p>I turned back to looking though Tisiel's notes, the same marking kept coming over over and over. It's one I saw in the other places also, first the graveyard, then the door in the cliff side and now here.</p>

<p>"Hey Tisiel, did you find out the purpose of that room?"</p>

<p>"In the cliffside? Yeah it was a tomb which was in keeping with the mausoleum from the grave yard, they seem to take great interest in death and taking their belongings with them to the grave."</p>

<p>"Think this place is related to death?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but on the flip side I am hoping to get more items for necromancy. Did you wake me up just to ask that?"</p>

<p>"You weren't asleep. Did you see Volker leave?"</p>

<p>"What? No, where did he go?"</p>

<p>"Into the jungle."</p>

<p>"Should we go after him?"</p>

<p>"No, I think the carving was creeping him out so he will just be outside."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>
<!-- need skull talking to necro girl  -->
<p>I could not help but think, all of the places we found these symbols where related to death, each was a place someone had been laid to rest with their belongings but not in the same fashion, the first was a mausoleum similar to Heilerbach's method for buying their dead rulers. The second a sealed door in a cliff side, contained a spirit trapped into a skull, and now a Pocotcotcan style pyramid.</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "Hey Otto, Tisiel."</p>

<p>"Oh hey you okay?"</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "Yeah just, a door in the cliff side with a person buried with all his belongings is not the best description, that door inside the cliffside is at the back of the housing area, its deep within a tunnel really."</p>

<p>"Yeah you're not wrong.."</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "Not being picky as such just, you might be interested to know thats how the dwarfs burry their dead. Deep in tunnels behind doors or large rocks with the things they wanted to take with them."</p>

<p>Otto - "The Dwarfs? You don't think these are just the resting places of the people from our continent do you? One for each style, maybe just from a previous settlement of the academy that is forgotten about?"</p>

<p>Tisiel - "No, that has holes, the strange symbols that don't match any writing system of our own, the strange coins, the places do have similarities granted but non of them are the same, the person buried in the cliffside was no dwarf, the king buried in the graveyard with necromantic items? Heilerbach's dominant religion holds the practice as evil."</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "So do the dwarfs."</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Yeah, this does not line up with the mainland, but yet has similarities."</p>

<p>Otto - "Tisiel, whats this symbol mean it comes up all over the place."</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Err, yeah that one is from the previous. Hold on. Monster? I thought it was monster but it makes no sense for them to be worshiping monsters, even necromancers don't worship monsters they use their bodies."</p>

<p>Volker - "Demons." Volker's voice boomed though the room and bounced of the walls, he strode up to the table and slammed down a dead doe. The blood splattered across the table from it's wounds. Volker drew a knife and cut the animals throat and the blood ran down the table to the hole and fell inside.</p>

<p>Tisiel - "What are you doing!? Now we can't read it. Where did you get that?"</p>

<p>Otto - "Demons?"</p>

<p>Shrorlei - "Is that your offering to them?"</p>

<p>Volker nodded. "Demons always want a blood sacrifice, that thing on the roof.." His words stopped short of explaining himself as the temple began to shake. Gently at first before a large violent trust, managing to keep balance everyone was up if Volker had not woke them before and the shaking suddenly stopped. To the right of the table where it had been floor before had slid open to reveal a passageway down into the darkness.</p>

<p>Shrorlei threw a manaball down the passageway the stairs spiraled down. I took a peek down and inside although it was hard to see where stone statue's all over. Stone warriors, Stone monsters, Stone wizards even a stone priest. Lastly there was a large stone king sitting on a stone throne. I looked to Tisiel. "A second king."</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Perhaps a third? We know to little of the cliffside tomb, but I won't rule it out."</p>

<p>Reingard & Volker & Shrorlei made their way down the stairs, followed by Raina and Tisiel. I waited looking at the doe laying dead on the table, its blood still dripping down into the hole in the middle. I looked up to see the monster carved into the roof, it did look as if it was staring at the doe which lay on the table. "Enjoy the meal."</p>

<p>I followed after the others down into the depths of the pyramid. The others where twisting and diving their way though the statues towards the king, I decided to head over to the priest to see what kind of clues about their religion I could find out about.</p>

<p>The priest had a ankle length robe with many colours and patters all over, some of birds and trees, not skulls or anything of death however. He held a large pole arm with an axe head and a spear head combined, it was a weapon pocotcotco warriors have been recorded using.</p>

<h4>POV Tisiel</h4>
<p>Down stairs were row after row of colorful statues of warriors and mages monsters and animals alike, there where a few larger then others and some so small you could keep them on your desk as a toy. The king was seated on a large throne with a crown atop his head.</p>

<p>We made a B line to the king, dodging and weaving between the stone people. The king was as colorful as his subjects with a crown of gold and many gems embedded inside. The statue's where all painted and although clearly made of stone the work was so well done as to be life like unlike the carvings which adorned the pyramid its self outside.</p>

<p>The kinds hands were wrapped around the chair he sat on, at his feet where offerings of food, wine, gold and weapons. Unfortunately they where just stone recreations. The only other things of note where his bodyguards and a stone tablet with the strange symbols written across them. This time however I could see the numbers which I found on some of the coins Otto had given me at the start. This was a list, of ... something.</p>

<p>Reingard had come to stand by me, I grabbed at the hem of his trousers. He just replied with a smile. Volker and Raina had taken interest in the king for awhile before looking around and marveling at the creatures some of which I had not even seen in books yet. Shrorlei had followed us at first but now she was to be found with a manaball in hand looking at the art on the walls. It seemed like at last me and Reingard had some time alone.</p>

<p>"You have not forgot why we came here?"</p>

<p>"No I haven't but where to start? There is nothing of value here. I mean nothing of value we can exchange easily, I am sure the place it's self is worth a small fortune to somebody."</p>

<p>"Hmm the boxes at the kings feet, it's in the book 10 for the demons of death and one for the lord. They might be stone but the insides should be what we came for."</p>

<p>"Right." Reingard moved to open the stone chests quickly and quietly as the others marveled at the at the the wonders on display.</p>

<p>Reingard stuff what he found into the bag at his waist and slide it under his cloak. As soon as he had Tisiel had finished making a sketch of the stone tablet they felt the pyramid shake again. A slow gentle rumble, building in intensity.</p>

<p>"Time to go" I shouted, grabbing my parchments and Reingard's hard we ran dodging ducking diving back though the stone warriors and to the stairs. Volker and Raina had clearly heard me and we made to to the stairs together, Otto and Shrorlei were no where to be seen. I tugged on Reingard's hand and we climbed the stairs looking out to try and spot them, Shrorlei could not be seen, she was not a tall girl she could be behind any of these statue's. Otto was not hiding himself at all, he stood atop a 10m tall statue of a stag. I shouted to him to come quickly, but he just did not move.</p>

<p>We waited in the room above for the other two worried the entranceway to the stairs would close any moment, when we had arrived on top the most obvious change was the doe that Volker had left on the stone table was gone. Not a trace was left not a single drop of blood. Suddenly the shaking stop. SLAM. I jumped the entrance way had shut tight.</p>

<p>Volker - "I guess we should get another to open it up for them again.."</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Yeah, let's hunt one quickly I don't think staying inside there will be good." We made out way into the jungle together to hunt.</p>

<h4>POV Shrorlei</h4>
<p>I had spent my time going though the art-work on the walls when I felt the pyramid shake again, before I could make to to the stair case I saw the others move up and the lid shut. I did no panic I had food, water and they would open the lid again, if not though a new hunt then getting help from the academy. Okay maybe I was a little panicked.</p>

<p>The art work had been beautiful but haunting. It had shown a war, a great war but not over land, food, water, precious gems but people. They had gone to war against other races for their people. To be precise the dwarves, elf's, gnoll's, gnomes and many I had never seen before. They took them to this temple, placed them on the tables and removed their hearts. It was hard to say why, or what they did with the hearts that was so important to them, the drawings just go into the creature of the stone statues around us now.</p>

<p>I walked towards the stairs, I should wait there. On my way back I felt a sudden and blow to the back of my head, it felt as if my brain way trying to jump though the front of my skull as I fell face first into the ground, my nose bent on impact the blood splattered across the floor. I felt too much of a shock to move much at all the pain soon surged though me and I became overwhelmed. Reaching for my knife.</p>

<h4>POV - Otto</h4>
<p>The group of Reingard, Tisiel, Volker, Raina had come back holding with them some dead rabbits, sitting in the with the things they had left behind I smiled down at them, waiting for them to climb the stairs so we could pack and head home.</p>

<p>"How, *pant* are you *pant* on the outside?"</p>
<p>"It opens from the inside."</p>
<p>"And you did not think to let Shrorlei out with you?"</p>
<p>"Shrorlei? I thought she left first?" - Otto</p>
<p>"We thought she was trapped in there with you." - Tisiel</p>
<p>"Let's just open it back up" - Volker</p>

<p>They had cut the rabbits on top of the table like before and spilt blood onto the table. While the others spent their time looking for Shrorlei I had opted to stay outside just incase with Tisiel. I told her I had found another coin around the priest and guardian sitting on a stone alter between them. Showing her the coin. It was similar to the coin in the last womans grave in weight & size. On her coin was a king with a skull for a face and the other a strange symbol like the symbols on the table upstairs. This new coin had the same symbol on one side and priest on the other holding a heart above a pyramid just like this one.</p>

<p>Soon the others came up while Tisiel was checking out the new coin, she placed it back in my hand as the others come up with ugly faces. "What is wrong?" Tisiel asked quietly beside me.</p>

<p>"Shrorlei is dead. Found her with her head beaten in and mostly crushed, a large hold in her chest. As soon as we found her we left, we should tell the academy." - Volker</p>

<p>Otto - "I know we are in shock, but we should move quickly. What ever killed her might still be in there or of been let free, there is nothing else we can do from here."</p>

<p>And like that we headed back for the academy, silence filled the hike home.</p>

<h4>Tisiel, Reingard</h4>
<p>Sitting together Reingard and Tisiel in Tisiel's room they looked over the items they got from the pyramid. 10 items in total, one matching each of the symbols on the table above. Tisiel took a staff with a skull affixed to the top which aided in the creation of skeletons. The other items would bring them in more money then they could earn working though the academy or even as mercenaries for a few years. These items where unique and that made them one of a kind, even if they were not the best combat pieces they would still be sort after.</p>

<p>I found myself sitting back in my room holding two coins, all of this was getting a bit weird. Although we had not found a coin in the cliffside it was surely a burial place as Shrorlei had said, does not mean there was not a coin down there just I did not find it. This time Shrorlei had lost her life. For a single coin the cost was too high, but for what was learned maybe the price had to be paid.</p>

<p>I decided to head down to Tisiel and Reingard and see what they had learned during this visit. As expected when I knocked they made me wait, sounded like they where clearing up in there but seeing them run around and pick up their clothes was not something I wanted to see. Stepping inside they stood awkwardly. "Sorry if you two where getting it on, I only came to ask about what you had translated so far."</p>

<p>Tisiel - "No no we were ... just come in it's fine, I have so much new information to look though, it's a shame the academy will be taking over the site and I won't be able to gather anymore first hand information but come take a look." She gestured me to come and sit as Reingard sat down next to her desk also. Across it was layed various books, items and coins.</p>

<p>"The various names printed on the table were things they gave offerings to, of blood. We believe animals and possibly humans or other races but we are unsure for now. The main point is there where 10 of them and they are kind of demons, I call them this because the blood and the references to them being down under so I think this is the best translation for now." - Tisiel</p>

<p>"What about the creature drawn above the table?"</p>

<p>"Not one of them, although it had kind of eyes to us, it is possible we are just projecting onto it and it might of been a drawing of something else so I am not sure what that was of."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Well onto the more interesting stuff. The people which made up these societies where obsessed with death, gods of death, demons of death and the practice of necromancy which is perfect for me that they died out and the practice is not as wildly used because what was theirs is now mine."</p>

<p>"As long as I get stronger I don't mind joining these expeditions. Although I cannot say I have a need or interest in necromancy. I am sure you will become one of the legends said to raise whole armies from the dead."</p>

<p>"Aha, I am happy with just a few cute skeleton helpers here and there. I don't plan on becoming a combat mage anyway. You might be more interested to know that the coins while they are magic items according to this..." Tisiel flipped though her note book and the book from the market to show me her notes. "They are a type of single use item."</p>

<p>"So I can use them but only once? How do I use the coins? What do they do?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you place them on your eyes, what to do is vague at best, something about their gods maybe demons? I would say beings worthy or pray?"</p>

<p>"So I am just going to have to try them to find out? Seems like a waste, it might be better to sell them."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I was thinking the same. I am sorry Otto I thought they would be more useful since they were found in important sites I really don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well I'll keep hold of them maybe we can shed more light on them in the future, it's not like I can sell them for the right price by saying I have no idea what they do, and when you use them they will be gone forever."</p>

<p>"Yeah...Sorry..."</p>

<p>"No worries, I am going to head back out and leave you two to .. studying."</p>

<p>"Later!" - Reingard</p>
<p>"Come round anytime!" - Tisiel</p>

<p>I left them and headed up topside to the training ground for the cliffside, overlooking the academy it was a nice place to come to, but today I did have something to practice. I had not told Tisiel everything that had happened down in that pyramid or everything I knew of the coins.</p>

<p>I got down on the floor and started to pray. I was never a religious man but I had found faith down in that pyramid. Praying was common in Alden, for those that had faith they could be granted spells or skills by the ones they pray to. I soon got a reply.</p>

<!-- Title Here -->
<h4>Title here</h4>

<p>"Hunt the stag."</p>

<p>A blinding pain filled my brain as images and information followed though. It was not just any stag that would do, an elemental creature the thunder stag. Most elemental creatures are rare, hard to find and tricky to handle. I imagine such a creature is far stronger then myself. I had got my first quest and I knew what I had to do, that was a start.</p>

<p>To help me along I had been granted 1 faith. I could use this to cast a spell of the deities choice and recharge it daily though prayer. I opened the menu to see what spell I had been granted, it was unlikely the spell could be changed.</p>

<p>"Kʼawiil's lightning seeds. Plant the seeds of lighting on a target and lightning skills will be amplified."</p>

<p>Ekʼ Chuah was not a lightning god, lightning demon or anything of the sort. Where in the hell did Ekʼ Chuah get a lightning power from and who was Kʼawiil? Too many questions, questions I feel I won't be getting the answers to.</p>

<!-- <p>God L grans the Power of god K though faith.</p> -->

<!-- Gods of worship require pray for awhile to grant faith based classes and then faith spells, gods of no worship have their attention on one or few individuals and are able to grand faith spells before to increase their following. Often gods fall out of fashion due to religious wars and differences or societal pressure. And you can get faith spells from the new god, maybe there spells suit you better or your society finds more acceptable the requirements such as the hunt or sacrifice will be popular before are not popular now. -->

<p>I went on the trip to become stronger, I had become stronger but not in the way I had hopped I had no more defences then when I left the arena rounds would start tomorrow the best I could do now was practice with my new skill get some rest and hope for good match ups.</p>

<p>I set off and headed to the arena, I met up with Reingard, Volker and Raina there. We would head into the armory below the arena, most students by now had their own weapons or had a set weapon they would use it was very rare for a student to change their weapon this far into the year. I would not be changing mine from my warhammer anytime soon.</p>

<p>Raina had a two handed staff with patterns of water craved throughout, Volker carried a wand with a small shield. Reingard however had come with a large metal chain around his neck and a large metal shield in his hand.</p>

<p>Otto - "Reingard."</p>
<p>Reingard - "Otto."</p>
<p>Otto - "Don't play dumb, what is that?"</p>
<p>Reingard - "Ah, I got this yesterday. I had managed to exchange some things for them. This is a metal kite shield imbue.."</p>
<p>Otto - "Not the shield."</p>
<p>Reingard - "Didn't even let me finish. Fine, its a magic chain weapon I exchanged for something important I had. I just could not resist it matches my element so well. Take a look."</p>

<li>Primary:<font color="blue">Kusari-fundo (half)</font> +3 Dexterity, can be extended or move with mana.</li>

<p>Otto - "How the hell do you plan to use this thing while holding a shield?"</p>
<p>Reingard - "Ah well it's only a half length so this is a handle, and the other end is weighted not both, think of it like a metal whip, because of my element I can exert some level of control over it."</p>
<p>Otto - "Alright.. Just don't hit me in the back of the head with it."</p>
<p>Reingard - "I promise not to hit you in the back of the head."</p>
<p>Otto - "Or the front"</p>
<p>Reingard - "Ot the front."</p>
<p>Otto - "Just, don't hit me anywhere with it! Your words make me uneasy!"</p>
<p>Reingard - "Aha, I will not hit you with it."</p>

<p>It was not long before the four of us found ourselves waiting at the foot of the entrance way to the arena, I had walked it before but that was when the arena was split and both combatants would enter though the same gate, it felt different this time. We walked the long curved tunnel up to the arena entrance the light at the end of the tunnel spread around the mouth of the exit. Blinded, our eyes soon adjusted and before us was a metal gate holding us back from entering the arena, the opposite team already waiting behind theres.</p>

<p>Arena Guard -- "You can move around in your half of the arena before the match stats, position how you like, set traps and cast spells but if you make a move, spell or anything else to the other half of the arena or combatants before the match stats you will be disqualified. Good luck."</p>

<p>There was a metallic screech and rumble as the bars fell into the earth, small holes left behind and we stepped out into the arena. We had 20 seconds to get ourselves into position and be ready to fight. The floor of the arena had a thin coating of sand not enough to effect walking but enough to soak up the blood I guess.</p>

<p>The opposing team was also a group of four, more traditional mage group with staffs, wands and a dai-furyo (hand fan). Reingard was stood in front of me a little to my left and Volker in front of Raina to our left. The match started with the sounding of a large bell, I opened with a wall of lightning wall in front of Volker's opponents, turning my attention to Reingard who had thrown his chain while keeping his shield up trying to strike a mage with a wand in the back, when they moved Reingard adjusted the path with his mana and stuck him in the stomach, the mage keeled over but was not out.</p>

<p>The mage in front of us with a staff slammed it to the ground in response broken earth and soil where flung at Reingard's eyes. I put on my lightning cloak spell and 'Charged Charge' into the staff wielding mage. I swung my warhammer high and he moved his staff high colliding together in a test of strength he lost badly (-17% health). Testing out my new faith spell I threw my left hand open and the seeds materialized and landed on him, clinging to him like barbed plants.</p>

<p>In return the wand mage stuck me with a lighting manaball, the earth mage followed up with an infused manaball of his own but I activated my boots and bounced behind Reingard who tanked the blast with his shield. As we moved forward my hand on his shoulder his shield up, I took the time to see how Volker and Raina where holding up. The arena near them had the air filled with flames and the ground covered in water, as the fan mage blew back the flames with his wind magic the other wand mage blew across the tip of his wand as a black cloud of smoke bellowed from the end and glided across the arena.</p>

<p>As we moved in range of these two mages Reingard charged into the lightning mage, I bounced out from behind him and struck the earth mage with chain-lightning. The seeds activated doing their job, a full 28% of his health disappeared and the bolt flew off to meet his friend. The earth mage was hanging just above 50% hp at this point, I was sure I could take him alone but was not confident I would leave the fight with the ability to help the others. I dashed back to see Reingard managing to hold off the lighting mage with ease but unable to inflict any serious damage, he would be okay if I left him with both mages for awhile out left flank is falling back.</p>

<p>The wand mages poison gasses had been burned up by Volker where he could but they where not looking the healthiest right now. The air mage used his large fan to move the poison clouds about and beat back the fire Volker had sent their way. Raina's water magic was great for healing but could not inflict any damage on her opponent's and like this they had been gaining the upper hand.</p>

<p>I bolted my way across the arena and activated 'Charged Charge', at almost 300 mana to start with I had dropped to about 80% remaining. The wind mage blow a gust my way but I did not stop, and collided with the poison mage, the lighting cloak flew off me and ran into him like a bolt as my warhammer met the side of his head. His body disappeared from the arena, the judges must of thought this a lethal blow. One down.</p>

<p>The wind mage backed up by pushing the wind in front of him and using it to glide backwards 1 meter, he was out of my range at over 1 meter since I could not charge with magic again so soon. "Help Reingard" I shouted to the others, I heard them run off away from me as I tried to corner the wind mage.</p>

<p>I ran straight for him trying to finish him off also when I was hit with a wind infused manaball, the blow had come so quick I did not register it at first (-43%). I could not allow him to keep that up, I stuck with lightning strike (-57%), he had high magic defences it seems. I sprinted into him with my warhammer striking his chest, his body soon disappeared from the arena as I felt a huge pressure above me push me down and a sucking woosh, next thing I saw was the arena underground where I had come in, standing next to an small water fountain at the base of the entrance tunnel to the area. I must of reached my last 10 hp, guess he still had enough mp left to use strike also.</p>

<!-- mana drain is power of spell * 10?  -->

<!-- lightning cloak, shocking touch, chain lighting, 'Charged Charge' and wall of lightning.
Mana ball (lightning) (Pow: 1), Tether, Magic resistance (passive), Magic up (passive), Strike (lightning) (Pow: 2),  Magic regen (passive) -->

<p>Soon enough my team mates came back down the tunnel, walking, they had won the rest of the match with Raina's healing waters they were able to grind though the rest of their health.</p>

<p>Otto - "Welcome back!"</p>
<p>Reingard - "Perhaps next time you could join us in walking back down."</p>
<p>Otto - "I'll work on it."</p>

<p>The was the end of our first match, we would not have to participate again until the next drawings in a week, with that in mind I took some time to watch some of the other matches.</p>

<h4>Spectator - POV commentator</h4>
<!-- Oblivion easter egg / arena dialogue -->
<p>"Welcome, welcome, to the Arena!"</p>
<p>We have two teams for you today, on the right the green team, and on the left the red team!</p>
<p>"You came to watch a fight, and a fight you shall have! It's a second year student team showdown in a battle to determine the victor! Lower the gates!"</p>
<p>The green team is made up of all fire-mages, perhaps they should of been the red team! The red team is a mixed group of water, ice, wind and light! This should be quite the showdown!</p>
<p>A heated start, the green team had throw fireballs, waves of flames and wisps all across the field! Red team rebutted with waterballs, ice walls, and a large gust of wind subduing the raging flames! A light has filled the arena shining in the eyes of the green team! What a start!</p>
<p>Green team are putting on the pressure again, fireballs and flamethrowers trying to group up the red team, the ice spears and water walls only doing so much to hold them back, light magic while powerful in areas is really struggling to hold back the flames it might be we have our first out.</p>
<p>What is this! Green team's team captain is summoning a fire elemental! This could be a game changer! Red team where already launching a plan of their own! Red teams wind mage has launched herself into the air!</p>
<p>Now she is airborne her wind infused manaballs are raining down  on the summoning mage with no defense to be found! This explains the green teams aggressive start they where doing it to protect their captain!</p>
<p>With their plan just a distant memory the green team are breaking down, some are shooting fireballs up others still trying to apply pressure, but with the split red team are making short work of green team.</p>
<p>"My friends, we have a winner! Behold, the combatants from the red Team! If you bet on the red Team, see the merchants to collect your winnings!"</p>

<h4>Fair Date</h4>
<!-- Gives Tsuma the witches hat -->
<p>Tsuma - "I have always wanted to be a witch, the kind of a broomstick, big witch hat, and a black cat."</p>
<p>Otto - "Just like the fairy tales, you would make a beautiful witch zooming though the sky on your broomstick."</p>
<p>Tsuma - "Aww, yeah something like that." She said softly and looked away a bit embarrassed by the compliments.</p>
<p>Otto - "Oh, I got you a gift." I took out the witches hat from my bag and handed it to her. "It's for you, it's a witches hat and a magic item so you can wear it whenever you like."</p>
<p>Tsuma - "Really? Really? It's for me? I can keep it? It's really expensive, you should use it for yourself."</p>
<p>Otto - "I would not make a great witch, I mean I use a warhammer for a start, it looks better on you, and I have another head piece so I really don't need it, it's yours now, it's a gift."</p>
<p>Tsuma - "Thank you." She replied with the cutest face, head down and holding onto the hat with two hands.</p>
<p>Otto - "Put it on let's see."</p>
<p>The hat fit her perfectly, it was a magical item after all and would always fit perfectly.</p>

<h4>tomb raid</h4>
<!-- Have item the mask, wand to detect magic, bouncy shoes. Titles & race! -->
<p>No sooner had I made it back inside of the cliff side I was ambushed by Tisiel and Reingard. The excitement on their faces left me feeling excited too I could not help but give a smile from ear to ear. Am I getting addicted to plundering the resting places of the dead? Something like this should horrify me.. What would my family think. Shaking of the cob-web like feeling of the ethics behind it I had to ask what they had found out this time.</p>

<p>Tisiel had told me she had found the location of another tomb, unlike the last times this tomb was not near the academy, or even above ground. While the cliff side study was underground the entrance was very visible if it had not been for the restrictions placed on the door and the genal acceptance that the cliff side was nothing worth thinking about another mage would of surely broken in before us.</p>

<p>The tomb was located over 300km away from the academy, this would not be a short sally out into the forest but a long expedition. We would need to sign out of the academy to do something like this, if we just up and leave without saying anything the academy might follow us and if they discover the tomb for themselves they might take all of the treasure as they have with the pyramid even banning us from going by saying it was dangerous. Well, Shrorlei had died but there was always danger involved when taking from the dead.</p>

<p>Reingard put forward a plan, one I was not to keen on but if it worked then we might just get back without pulling too much attention to ourselves. After all once might of been luck, but if we discover an old tomb twice, people would start asking questions.</p>
<!-- Tisiel" Reingard".  -->

<p>In the morning the next day we made our way into the academy, Reingard went off to get food and other miscellaneous supplies. I made my way into one of the cafe's with Tisiel, we took a table with 4 chairs and spread out a map across the table.</p>

<!-- unique race, lighting resistance, lightning trap -->

<p>We had not been there more then 1 hour before we were approached by a group of older students in the 3rd year, they made to block any exit routes before asking about our maps, where we were going, what had we found. This kind of treatment was obviously taboo and they would never behave like this with other students. However we were not normal students, we where students in the first year, from the cliffs, there was no way we had any backing.</p>

<p>There was 5 of them in total, the first to approach us and speak had a sly smile across his face, hair pushed back as if he had just run both his greasy hands though his hair. Since they where in the 3rd year they must be doing their work experience here in the academy. At least we could be sure they were not direct combat mages. The only reason a mage might stay is to study theory under one of the professors.</p>

<p>"Look, we know you are the ones who came across that pyramid. You should of had us with you then you might of made it back with some of those treasures before the academy could lay claim to all of them. Tell you what if one of you dies again on this trip we promise not to tell the academy, and if you don't die we will even help you keep one treasure. How generous is that? Thats 100% more treasure then you kept last time. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I had to hand it to him, he would be great at selling water to fish. The words clearly stated he did not care if we lived or died as long as he got his hands on some treasure and made it sound like it was a great deal for us. I gave a small passing smile to Tisiel, it seems we would have no choice but to bring them with us if we didn't want the academy finding out.</p>

<p>Before we had a chance to reply, his hand slammed down in the middle of the table bringing the attention of everyone in the cafe.</p>

<p>"What's it gonna be!?" As he looked between us my eyes flitted over to Tisiel, he quickly picked up on this. Tisiel would be hard pressed to forgive me for that mistake. Staring at Tisiel he spoke slowly. "So you are the brains are you? Figures, this guys has too much muscle to be a real mage".</p>

<p>As those words left his mouth I could not help but wonder how skinny he was under that robe. I was by no means a mountain of muscles, even Reingard was larger then I was. However everyone here knew muscles would not help in a fight between mages as most mages do not put any stat points into strength so their muscles would just be for show.</p>

<p>Tisiel - "Looks like we have no choice but to welcome you on our trip..."</p>

<p>"Hey don't say it so defeated, this is a good thing for you. We are your seniors after all, you are more likely to come out alive with us around, you might learn something and if you are really lucky maybe you will catch one of our eyes.." The last line came out with a creepy drawl.</p>

<p>All we could do was sit there as they joined us at the table and we told them when and where we were going and what we had found at the pyramid, we might of embellished a little when it came to the amount treasure found and lied a little about where the treasure was now, namely in the hands of some of the professors at the academy. Thankfully they believed us thinking that we were so inferior it never crossed their minds that we would lie to them, or maybe it just lined up with that they thought was already true. Either way, to be sure, I had no doubts that we would go "missing" during this trip of ours, and after our rooms would be turned over.</p>

<p>Our discussion continued for another few hours, we agreed that they would pick us up and take us to the location of the tomb. We would provide them with our understanding of the previous tombs, and act as guides, no doubt this meant guinea pigs for the various traps there could be found throughout such old tombs. In return they would offer us protection, both from the various monsters and the academy by providing them academy with the explanation that we were occupying them as field hands for their studies. This would actually lift the suspicions of the academy members as such group outings where not uncommon as a benefit to both parties and would likely never venture anywhere too dangerous or be able to find anything that would interest or value for the academy to step in.</p>

<p>One month later they arrived outside of the cliffs early in the morning. The 5 from the cafe and one more who we did not know or agree upon. Tisiel & Reingard where up waiting in the living area down stairs before I had made it down, since the 3rd years where unwilling or unable to get into the cliff side we had a small window of time to double check our side of the plan. After all there was no way we were really going to agree to what they have suggested in the cafe.</p>

<p>With fake smiles placed on our faces, inventory full of supplies and academy robes on our backs we left to meet with the group waiting outside. The awkward greetings over they quickly informed us the new guy was given permission to go into the field for his studies and could take others with him as help. This way they could pass though without raising any suspicions during a time when the academy was clamping down on student exploration outside of the academy grounds.</p>

<p>The target was a cave entrance far to the north of the academy, Tisiel claimed that her sources state the cavern of despair has not been discovered this age and would hold the relics and treasures of most of the past civilizations. Each civilization to discover the cavern have used it as an armory and last line of defense. The reason being is once you have control over the cave you can activate the ancient sealing and defensive spells, such spells are unheard of in modern times and make the cave a perfect safe. Lucky for us, no one is currently occupying the cave.</p>

<p>All of this leads to the assumption that when each civilization discovered the ruins of the others and plundered it for what might of been useful the items, texts and anything of real value would of been moved into the cave. What was left behind might be of value to us in the modern day but to them was not worth as much as what they stored away.</p>

<p>It took a few days travel the we found our selves far beyond the sight of the academy, in a field where the grass grew to the hight of a tall man. The blades seem sharp to the touch and would leave paper cuts on your bare skin if you where not careful. We were harassed by large flying beatles around level 1 ~ 4 ambushing us in quick raids. A melee attack was too hard, they where the size of a fist up to the size of a skull but moved too quickly so magic worked better.</p>

<p>After a week of this we found that the grass started to grow shorter and we eventually found sand, the academy had taken an interest in this sand during its foundation and initial exploration of the land around it, the sand contains traces of mana inside, not enough to be useful as studies showed but it was still of interest, after a few more days we found that the grasslands had been replaced by a desert of this sand, with sandstorms raging constantly inflicting small damage as we went.</p>

<p>After more traveling Tisiel finally shouted over the sound of rushing sand, "Should be near by, watch out for places where the sand looks like it's sinking in, it's either the cave entrance or a sink pit."</p>

<p>To be honest, even with the supplies we brought along and knowledge of the area from the academy, I would not of predicted just how tired everyone had become, by now the party only spoke if they had to, the fake faces had fallen away.</p>

<p>It was at this point the voice of my God spoke to me, "This land is the death lands. You should go back. You are not strong enough to be here."</p>

<p>"I am not strong enough to run away either, all I can do is pray you watch over me as your only follower."</p>

<p>"...Who told you I had no other followers!?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well your temple is abandoned, your people gone and the worship of a God of death is ... frowned upon."</p>

<p>"No longer abandoned, full of your people now. My people also did not worship death at first, no one choses death if they have another choice. My people chose death at the end, like those before us. That is why there is always temples to death left behind. You should know. You also chose their path, you chose me."</p>

<p>A long pause filled the air as the group looked around silently for the holes in the sand, exhausted and on guard. "So are you going to help me out? I will help you out in return."</p>

<p>"It's not like I don't need you, it's the only reason I am feeding you power. I could set you a task with a high reward... But there are rules about what can be done. Let see what I can do. In return, later I need more followers, the other Gods of death must have also woken and be building their power base."</p>

<p>"Deal, any task that helps me get out of this mess would work just fine."</p>

<p>The sand whipped our faces, Reingard almost fell into a sand trap. One of the 3rd years did get his foot stuck in one, lost his boot in the process of being dragged out, he had a fat face, bulbous ruddy nose and crooked front tooth. Ditwin was his name, an earth mage specialising in rocks mostly. During the fights with the beatles in the grasslands his abilities produced great rocks the size of a mans chest for both defense and offence but in the end achieved very little with his poor accuracy.</p>

<p>It was Linhart that first found the cave entrance by chance, the leader of this group and an adept fire mage from a fire mage family. Between all of the 3rd years he was the most capable mage and the highest level thanks to his family. He had stumbled into a sand trap only to try and blast his way out with fire, lucky for him it was the entrance to the cave and not a trap otherwise all he would of done was fused the sand together while still inside.</p>

<p>We all scrambled into the cave entrance, it was half the height of a man at the mouth but once inside and down the entrance slope the roof stood at over 30 meters up. What was most surprising was that at first I expected to be plunged into complete darkness but the rocks inside of the cave gave off a weird ethereal blue glow here and there. Wisps of blue light danced across the walls, rushing from one side and disappearing just as quickly as it sprang to life.</p>

<p>We spend about a day milling around and recouping ourselves, as far as we knew this was the only way in or out and we could leave behind some of the supplies for the return journey. The plan was to go in and map out the ruins as best we could, find anything of interest and head back.</p>

<p>We went in as expected, Tisiel, Reingard, Myself, followed by Ditwin, Gelfrat, Hildebold, Linhart, Nymandus and finally Petsche. The reason we were first? Well that was because if there was any traps, guess who would be the ones to find out the hard way.</p>

<p>After a short walk though the tunnel wide enough to stand only 2 by 2 we soon exited though to another larger cavern. Before us was a giant temple, with columns stretching far into the air but not touching the roof, they appeared to be randomly placed coming out of the ground with nothing on top. In the middle was a large building with an open entrance. All of this was raised into the air on several platforms.</p>

<p>Before we could reach even the first platform there was a large distance between us and it. Clearly this area would be filled with traps, death and trickery. However the place felt calm as if the atmosphere down here was asleep, undisturbed for a long time, I would bet non of the traps here where active, expect if I made such a bet it could cost me my life.</p>

<p>Just as we were standing in awe, Ditwin shoved all three of us from behind. "Move it. We came for treasures not site seeing." He grunted out angrily as if he would even be down here without us. As we neared the temple Ditwin shouted out "Hey once we are inside don't touch any of the treasures, they might be traps." Gelfrat started to snicker next to him as soon as he said this.</p>

<p>Tisiel, Reingard and Myself just looked at each other, it was not their first time searching ruins but it was clearly not ours either. Resisting the urgh to speak back, we were the first to step inside. Inside was a stone alter in the middle of the room and three doors ahead of us with a symbol on each. Around the room with even spacing between them was 9 statues, each holding different weapons and wearing masks adorned with feathers.</p>

<p>They where not like the statues found in the pyramid, made of clay and stone. These where made of the same black stone found around the cave which gave off a strange lightblue glow across their surfaces now and again. On the alter was an indented hand print and some writing in the strange symbol's around the hand print in a circle.</p>

<p>As Tisiel was attempting to translate what it said Gelfrat walked right up to the alter. "It's a hand print you morons it needs a hand." Gelfrat said as he proceeded to push his hand into the indent. To nobody elses shock this was a mistake, a few spikes pushed up into and though Gelfrat's hand and out the other side regardless of skin or bones. Blood dripped down the spikes and flowed across his hand filling the indent. His screaming filled the round hall bouncing off the walls so that we could not even think clearly.</p>

<p>Soon as the indent was filled with blood the spikes retracted and he was free. He fell to the floor and fainted. "A blood price must be paid, willingly or not. That's the translation. A slaves hand would be put onto here to give up their blood if no one was willing, you can see in the carved pictures around the bottom of the alter people cutting their palms and sharing the blood cost." Tisiel chimed in almost sounding a little too happy about the translation.</p>

<p>"Why did you not say that sooner!?" Ditwin spat out.</p>

<p>"He gave me no time." Tisiel replied without a care.</p>

<p>"Earth ball!" Ditwin called mana though his body into his hand in the shaped of a ball and fused his earth element within, as soon as the rock was formed he shot it towards Tisiel.</p>

<p>Tisiel tried to dodge out of the way but combat was not her strong point and so moved far to slow and a loud 'Thud' noise arrived as the rock hit her in the shoulder. She screamed out in pain and Reingard ran to her side and shot a frosty look at Ditwin and reached for his sword.</p>

<p>"Now, now. There is no need for violence. Gelfrat honorably gave up his blood so we may enter. No one would believe he was fool enough to now know what he was doing, he knew all along. Now put down your anger..." Linhart walked though the middle of the two parties that had formed.</p>

<p>Ditwin had the face of a raging storm but did not keep up the assault. Tisiel injured stayed in Reingard's arms looking back with a cold stare, Reingard did not take his hand off his blade but did not move knowing the 3rd years would not side with him he would have to hold his tongue for now.</p>

<p>Soon after Hildebold, Nymandus and Petsche filled into the room making it quite the squeeze in here with the statues surrounding us. "You arguing about which path to take? We could just split up." Petsche said as he walked in seeing the small stand off.</p>

<p>"Path?" No sooner had Linhart asked a cold wind pushed past us without enough force to blow our hair around, turning back all 3 passageways had opened during our little fight and the smell coming from them was like weeks of rotten milk.</p>

<p>"Smells worse then Ratboy." Petsche added. Linhart and Hildebold started to giggle holding back laughter as Gelfrat stared fixed at Petsche, as he was about to say something Ditwin interrupted everyone "Smells worse then 1st years more like." Awkward silence filled the room again. Nymandus never said a word just pinched his nose at the smell and looked at the bloody alter and furrowed his brows.</p>

<p>"Right, Ditwin and Gelfrat go left you two should be able to find gold." Linhart gave orders out to each to make groups, before he had finished Ditwin and Gelfrat walked off first down the left route before they could be stuck with some 1st year. "Reingard, Tisle, Hildebold & Petsche go in the middle. Nymandus and myself and Otto will go right."</p>

<p>As we stepped up to the entrances Tisle whispered to me, "The doors are marked easy, medium and hard. Be careful in there." I gave a short nod and walked though.</p>

<h4>Vault Tomb</h4>

<p>We walked in single file up some stairs. At the top where bridges all leading in different directions and non of the staying still. Some moved up and down others left and right as they attached themselves to different exits at the other end. The bridges sometimes moved slowly and other times jerked suddenly as if to throw off whoever was walking on them, this would undoubtedly work as the bridges where very narrow.</p>

<p>"Really? A dexterity test for mages?" Linhart seemed to recognize this arrangement as being a test for dexterity, it made sense that he might know about these things as his family where landed knights in one of the provinces. No doubt his family had access to more knowledge and a better understanding of the world then my own.</p>

<p>He pulled a small vile filled with green liquid from his cloak, drank it all in one and jumped onto a bridge and started running. As the bridge below him moved he kept his balance, when it jolted hard he seemed to bounce and land back on it. "Dexterity potion, it raises your dexterity for a short period of time." Nymandus said from behind me as I watched, as I was about to reply the bridge suddenly jolted left and then back right, this threw Linhart off and he went falling down below.</p>

<p>Luckily there was enough bridges that he just landed on another further down. Nymandus just let out a small sigh and turned to me, pushed his hands out palm up and said some strange words, I felt myself become lighter and more agile. "What was that?" I asked. "Blessing of my God, we should have higher dexterity now, let's try to get across" he replied while casting the same blessing onto himself.</p>

<p>"Wish me luck." I said to myself more then Nymandus and jumped onto a passing bridge. I ran along the moving bridge for about 4 paces before it jerked violently to the right and I fell. I hit my shoulder on the bridge below and rolled off to the side landing on another further down. Linhart laughed but then soon paled when he saw Nymandus stroll across the bridges with a zig zag walk that let him walk across without falling down once. Now we were split up it seemed that each of us would face the next trial alone, looking at the dark entrance I stepped inside before waiting for the others.</p>

<p>Inside of the entrance was a rounded area with a door at the opposite end, a few skeletons and a symbol above the door. While I was no good at deciphering I recognize this as the number 5. No doubt Nymandus was looking at the number 1 and Linhart the number 3, if it matched the amount of entrances we missed by falling down. Without Nymandus's blessing though I would of fallen so far I would of either died or seen the number 100.</p>

<p>The room was quite simple, apart from the door at the far end the only thing to note was the large body of water in the middle of the room, leaving a small gap around the edge of the room to walk on. Just as I was about to step in and walk around his voice whispered in my ear.</p>

<p>"Scratches."</p>

<p>For an all powerful God he sure seemed like he was saving his power to comminate. But of course I stopped and looked around some more. The fuck dose he mean scratches? Did he give me a nickname like a cat? Maybe he is playing with a cat up there...</p>

<p>I looked across the water and around the edges, I looked at the roof the walls, and even the gaps between the water and the walls. I was about to give up on this senile old God when I noticed scratch marks, they where faint but maybe 3cm long from the gap down into the water. Clearly if I tried to walk around something would drag me into the water. Did the fall from the bridges damage my brain? We are inside a vault or tomb or whatever this place was in the past it is a tomb now, of course it wouldn't be as easy as walking around.</p>

<p>Kicking a nearby pebble into the water... No reaction. Maybe the thing died in there after all this time...</p>

<p>I gathered a ball of mana into the palm of my hand, and infused lightning into it until it was glowing blue, sparking and ready to break apart and threw it into the water. 1, 2, 3, nothing ... Then the water started to splash around and kick up waves, the walls got soaked and just as suddenly it stopped.</p>

<p>So did I electrocute it's body and dispute being dead that caused it to move, or did I shock it and it's still alive? So I threw 2 more inside.</p>

<p>Just as before, waves kicked up the water roiled and suddenly stopped. So I threw a few more down. After the 20th or so ball a giant writing red monster with tentacles of unknown length, eyes as big as my whole body and a head as large as the room burst up from the water. It lurched forward stopped by an unknown force keeping it from going past a few centimeters outside of the water and opened a hole below it, spikes ran along the hole and out from inside came a huge roar. Spit and bile sprayed all over also being stopped by the unknown force falling onto the floor below and like slop rolled back into the water.Then, it spoke. "Stop tickling me! Are you here to torment me? I was asleep for so long then awoken by your constant tickling!"</p>

<p>"I was just seeing if you where still alive..."</p>

<p>"Well I am, so be on your way."</p>

<p>"Are you gonna pull me into the water if I walk past?"</p>

<p>"Well not anymore! If you came down to check if I am still alive you must be that monsters apprentice, just get out of here and tell him I am alive and doing as he commanded. DO NOT TELL HIM I WAS ASLEEP!"</p>

<p>"Alright deal, I'll tell him you where awake and doing a good job and you won't drag me down. Would be embarrassing for us both if he had to come down and get me out."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" And with that the monster dove back into the water.</p>

<p>Not sure if he was still listening I quickly skipped around the edge. True to his word he did not drag me down, as I pushed open the door to the other side he flicked his tentacle and splashed water up my back... It was as cold as ice, but honestly although I looked miffed inside I was just pleased I had not become dinner.</p>

<!-- Re do with a lion? -->
<p>As the door closed behind, I made my way up the winding stairs and saw the next symbol... of course it stood for the number four. Pushing the door open inside were three coffins. I needed no warning to know this place was dangerous, I was lucky to get past the last, but unless the dead could talk and be tricked ... easily ... then I don't think this will be easy.</p>

<p>The skeletons in this room where too many to count, the floor itself seem to be made of the bones of failures. Bite marks accompanied the length of each and every bone, death in here would mean becoming food. I sat down cross legged and tried to look around as much as I could for clues or just an idea. A lot of time passed, I am not sure how long but I got bored. I coated myself with the lightning cloak and walked onto down the few stairs and onto the floor. I crept forward slowly... and could only wonder if they too had fallen asleep...</p>

<p>BANG!</p>

<p>One of the coffin lids jolted a little making a small gap between the coffin and the lid. A sound was coming from inside, it was intense screaming and scraping, the scream sounded like two stones where being rubbed together. My ear drums wanted to burst from the pain.</p>

<p>I ran holding my ears as they bleed out down my cheeks, I almost made it to the door at the far side when loud bangs started to come from the other coffins, red hand and long arm attached shot out from the larger gap being made by the constant banging from inside, the end of the hand looked burnt the nails long and black launched at my head. I grabbed hold of the door and pulled it open and tried to pull it closed behind me as the coffin lid finally fell from the coffin onto the floor, the last thing I saw was eyeballs held into a rotting skull by over stretched red muscles the eyeball was tinged yellow ******</p>
<!-- starvation symptoms -->

<!-- Bridge or riddles? -->

<p>The door was marked with 3 lines, while this was one of the symbols, it stood for 3 and did not take much to translate. On the other side of the door was yet another weird room, there was no floor this time just a bottomless black pit with mist rising from below. Across which was an old wood and rope bridge which swang in the .... lack of wind. Sitting at the foot of the bridge was Linhart. He gave me a quick look over his shoulder before saying. "So the stairs outside lead down to the other entrances?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Best not to go backwards though. What's with this bridge? Is there another monster that pulls you off?"</p>

<p>"Another? Hmm not quite, there is some kind of ghost in the middle that pushes you off if you cannot answer his riddle."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"... I have my methods."</p>

<p>"Okay. What was the riddle?"</p>

<p>"What is black and white and red all over?"</p>

<p>Some part of me just wanted to laugh. "That's it? What's the trick?"</p>

<p>"Confident? You are welcome to go first."</p>

<p>"Hmmm what was your first answer?"</p>

<p>"... Angry badger."</p>

<p>Keeping the best straight face I could. "Well you are not wrong..."</p>

<p>"Trust me, it was wrong."</p>

<p>I almost lost myself laughing, this guy was the leader of the group that joined ours, if they where all like this guy I feel like none of them will make it into the inner tomb alive. I strode forward and onto the bridge and started making my way to the middle. "You got a death wish!?" Linhart shouted from behind me. The mist coming from below gathered into a figure in the middle of the bridge to block my path.</p>

<p>"To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be removed from the bridge into the pit blow. What is black and white and red all over?"</p>

<p>"A newspaper." I replied casually. The ghost gave a short nod and dispersed back into mist surrounding the bridge. I turned to see Linhart gaping at me. "How did you know the answer? Newspapers aren't even red!" He shouted across from where he sat.</p>

<p>"Read as in reading not red as in the colour." With that short reply I turned and finished crossing the bridge. "You know the answer now so you might as well come over." I shouted across to Linhart. With a red face and some hesitation he stepped onto the bridge and again the ghost formed in the middle.</p>

<p>"To pass you must answer a riddle, get it wrong and you will be removed from the bridge into the pit blow. The more of this there is, the less you see. What is it?"</p>

<p>Linhart blanked. The look on his face of panic and deep thought. The answer again was obvious, was this just to keep children out? What was even the purpose of this riddle ghost? "Hurry up already." I shouted across.</p>

<p>"I don't know the answer the riddle has changed you bastard!" Linhart shouted back to me.</p>

<p>"That is incorrect." With out any hint of emotion the ghost dissipated back into mist and Linhart was flung off the bridge and shot into the dark pit blow with a look of despair and anger on his face, screaming the whole way down.</p>

<p>On reflection I guess the ghost takes your first reply as your answer. Still was it so hard? Maybe it was, maybe because my dad told me childish riddles everyday I find this kind of thing easy. With a shrug I walked though the door and up the stairs to the door marked with two.</p>

<h4>part 2</h4>

<p>As soon as I opened the door I saw Nymandus standing in the middle of the room, he turned and looked directly at me. "I was just coming down to get you both, Linhart is not with you?"</p>

<p>"He fell... How did you get here? And how did you know I would be here?"</p>

<p>"Hmm? The first door was marked with one line, once I cleared that floor I saw the real entrance, this whole bridge set up looks like an after thought, an add on to the original. I came back to the stairs that lead down and came into this room, while it was easier then the first I guess I still took to long to save Linhart. How did you make it up and not him? He was stronger then you."</p>

<p>"You cleared a floor? The monsters here are ... strong. The third floor was a riddle ghost, he got the riddle wrong. I'll wait here if you want to check it for yourself."</p>

<p>"I think a powerful necromancer made these floors, an added layer of protection. All of the monsters are undead and old, maybe the necromancer is dead because they are weaker then they should be." With a flash a ball of white mana appeared in his hand. "I am a light mage, all things undead are weak to my magic." He looked down and squashed the light ball out of existence "Give me a moment to go see this ghost and if there is a way to get Linhart back. Wait here." With that he walked off down to the lower floor.</p>

<p>In his absence I took a look around the room. A human skull on boney spider legs, serval of them lay around the room, as I turned I saw behind me the remains of a giant spider, it must of died a long time ago and was reanimated in this tower by the necromancer as Nymandus said. Now it lay dead in a pile to the right of the door I came in though, I wonder if it was already dead or if Nymandus really killed it himself.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room coated in dust on a small stone pillar was a glass bottle, I blew on it and dust filled the air, rubbing the side gently I could see inside the glass bottle was a cloud, not just any cloud of gas but a cloud like you see in the sky, trapped inside a little bottle. As I rubbed more dust off I could see it was a little storm complete with sea water below also, this is interesting. I placed it inside my inventory for now.</p>

<p>Nymandus soon came back, his face was unreadable. I felt like he had more experience then the others, they where all older then us but they acted no older at all as if their time at the academy had been shut in to dark rooms unaware of how quickly you can lose your life. Maybe sitting in dark rooms had sent them all mad.</p>

<p>"So Linhart is gone. Did the ghost kill him? You said he fell."</p>

<p>"He guessed the riddle wrong and although he was clearly pushed I didn't see what pushed him."</p>

<p>Nymandus paused in thought for awhile before replying, "Well the ghost is banished now, it's a shame I did not make it in time. Any thoughts to what these extra trials are or why they where added on before the real entrance?"</p>

<p>"Not a clue, I had no idea until you told me but I guess each era will add their own protection measures on top of the old, maybe that is why this place became so hard to break into."</p>

<p>Nymandus thought for a while before nodding and taking me into the first room. The inside was a mess, a large skeleton made of of the bones of many species with serval skulls, bone spikes protruded out of its back and its legs where made of many bones almost like round cages instead of a single bone anywhere. If it ever had flesh it had long since gone. While it lay on the ground the stone floor had burn and slash marks all around even the room was not untouched. If it where not for the mage light Nymandus was casting the room would be been pitch black, since he said he spent the longest here I have to assume he killed this creature.</p>

<p>We pushed though the last door and entered a long corridor at the end was large pillars with a portal in the middle. Since it was still active we stepped though. Waiting on the other side was the rest of the groups, at opposite ends of the room. Of course the first question we got asked was where is Linhart. "He will be catching up later, he went back to the camp to get potions he had a hard battle." Nymandus told the group. Although I held my poker face on the outside I was relived inside that he said something like that, if Ditwin found out he died I could only imagine his reaction.</p>

<p>"Well, since Linhart has gone back I guess we should wait here for him or head on back as well" Ditwin replied to Nymandus.</p>

<p>Nymandus thought for a moment before saying "I came to preform research on the undead, this place is a treasure trove of undead here, would be a shame to give up on even a day down here... Why don't you two stay just encase there are any treasures to be had. What with my concentration being on the ghosts and zombies who else could be left in charge of treasures."</p>

<p>Ditwin agreed. "Can't leave treasures under the supervision of the younger students, they won't know what is good and what's not. Morons all of them. Can't be trusted."</p>

<p>Nymandus just nodded. "Tisiel do you think this is the original entrance?"</p>

<p>"Yeah... I am not sure what was here before, but the three separate areas we just traveled though seemed to be some kind of challenge at different levels. I am not sure it's purpose since they all lead to the same place. This seems to be an older structure I am not too sure if it's the original but it was defiantly here before the one we are in now."</p>

<p>"We move forward then."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't the entrance have protection on it?"</p>

<p>Tisiel "Yes but it looks like either age or force have ruined it. Take a look these runes are broken and faded, even if the killing array or traps work since these are the detection runes none of them should activate. In Theory."</p>

<p>"Since you say so, test out your theory." Ditwin sneered as he moved to block them from retreating away. Tisiel just responded by walking though the entrance way with confidence. After stepping though Tisiel added "Basic rune theory is taught as an optional class, maybe you should try it some time."</p>

<p>We followed Tisiel's lead though the entrance way, along a bright marble white corridor lined with statues holding large weapons made of the same stone as themselves, they where not a similar style to the ones found in the pyramid but no doubt they had a similar function of protecting the inside from invaders. Luckily like the entrance way they seem to be inactive.</p>

<p>At the far end where maybe a door should of been was just a large hole in the wall, it looked like it had been broken though and then tied up after but never replaced. Beyond that it became clear for the first time why this place had the reputation as a safe. With stone walls which must of been enchanted with magic and not made of any normal stone as although there where large blast marks and other evidence of battles taking place here not a single one was out of place and looked like they had not moved from the moment they had been placed.</p>

<p>The walls spanned around the entrance in a semi-circle giving the intruders no place to go. After the first wall where more walls each progressively higher until the final layer which reached the roof of the cave. Turrets and platforms lined the walls breaking them apart into sections. There must of been more to it that we could not understand or magic we where unaware of but no doubt the academy would have a field day here.</p>

<p>Just as I was spacing out & looking around at the breath taking sight Dipshit broke the silence. "Well that's just bloody great. How are we suppose to get inside!?"</p>

<p>"Though the gate Ditwin" Nymandus replied in an almost bored tone as if this outing had turned into taking a child though a museum they had no interest in. Sure enough in the direction Nymandus was pointing was a large gate house in the first wall, at around 8m tall with thick square towers flanking either side of a gate way. The metal gate was not lowered and so we walked though, zig zagging our way up though each of the walled sections.</p>

<p>After passing though without so much as a scratch from the abandoned defences the final wall with a tunnel like gate way which was 15m long in complete darkness opened into a room lit with dim fires around the perimeter. The moment Reingard step inside a slow clap came from the other end of the room. Clap. Clap. Clap. Followed by a voice like gritted sand " [Gibberish] "</p>

<!--  "Ah young apprentices you overcame the trials I set ... Hmmm wait no, that's wrong. W-What year is it? You do not look like [Mayan's] at all." -->

<p>We all turned to look at Tisiel.</p>

<p>"I've never heard their spoken language before... I have no idea what he said. Let me just.." With that she pulled out a skull from a bag at her waist and held it up. The reaction of the others was pure confusion but they said nothing.</p>

<!-- skull = 5 civilizations including his own, then left in the study.

<p>"[gibberish]" The skull said.</p>

<!-- Not seen a Mayan myself for.. Who knows how long it has been. -->

<p>As the skull spoke to the voice from the other side of the room we slowly approached, since Tisle started to walk forward as well, soon I could make out that there was a man sitting on a throne at the other end. The closer we got the more I could make out that this man had no eye balls, no skin. However he did have a few small muscles and ligaments along with his bones and clothes. While I am no expert and there is no way to tell right now how old this corpse is, it is truly remarkable that its condition is this good.</p>

<p>"So that you all know, this gentleman here has been sitting here for longer then Alden has been a country, far longer. His was actually the last civilization before the one when I was sealed into that witches workshop. He is actually from the same people who built the pyramid although from a different faction, he worshiped a god of life while they worshiped a god of death. Ironic he became an undead I suppose..."</p>

<p>Nymandus - "A god of life? What a great injustice he became an undead.. I would like to inquire about how such a thing would even happen. If he is willing I would be willing to purify him, if not well I will have to do it anyway."</p>

<p>"Ah yes well I was getting to that, he does not know why it happened or how, it was actually one of the great mysteries of their end-times why so many undead came from this place but I think once we go deeper I will be able to help shed light on this. So please do send him on his way." With a simple nod Nymandus walked up to the undead man sat on the throne, their eyes or lack of in his case met and the undead mad nodded to him as Nymandus approached placed his hands on his head and gentle white light was released into his head. With that the man turned to dust.</p>

<p>"Should we not of found out why he built that weird trial to get in here?"</p>

<p>"Oh right, to test apprentice from his tribe, he was trying to find one with the talent to make it past this room. Their church of life I guess you could call it did not control this tomb at any point and only later arrived after the majority collapse of their civilization, those who did had already sealed themselves within."</p>

<p>"Fuck all that, what are you!?" Gelfrat piped up.</p>

<p>"Oh right, first time meeting I suppose. I was once a man and now I am a skull I suppose."</p>

<p>"But I can sense you are not the same kind of undead he was. I don't understand." - Nymandus</p>

<p>"Ah well I guess you would call me a sentient magic item, at least that is what I have come to learn so far but I have only been with you all for a short time.."</p>

<p>The third years where all shocked. A sentient magic item. This is not something anyone could just have let alone so casually pull it out. Sentient items where so rare if the Grand duke of Alden even had a sentient item no one knew about it because he would never bring it out, let alone anyone of the other houses. The idea that this first year, and the weakest first year possible was walking around with a sentient item left their minds reeling.</p>

<p>The first to move was Ditwin, as he strode forward Nymandus shouted "Stop!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean stop!? That is worth millions!" Ditwin pointed to the skull in Tisiel's hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, and its sentient. Do you even know what that means? Even if you did take it from her, the moment you get back to the academy it could just tell the deans it was sentient, and you had stolen it. Don't let your greed blind you."</p>

<p>"And so what? What if I just store it and don't let it out."</p>

<p>"You cannot store sentient items. That's why she had it in her bag. You are a research student Ditwin you should know this much at least. Even if you did want it, what made you think you would be the one to come out on-top if we all started fighting right now? We haven't fought before Ditwin, but I know your second year ranking and I know mine."</p>

<p>"If I can't have it I wont be silent about you having it either Nymandus."</p>

<p>"None of us could keep something like this to ourselves, we will turn it in for other rewards back at the academy. Even after we get rid of it the rumors that Tisiel had this in her possession..." He turned to Tisiel "People will hunt you to find where you got it."</p>

<p>"I know, but had I not just now, we would all be dead. He had just found out he was an undead, any longer and he would of gone mad and killed us all, you should know this better then us Nymandus."</p>

<p>"Yeah... We will just say we found it here. That might help a little.."</p>

<p>With a sigh the skull continued "You all have a very basic understanding of sentient magic items but shall we first solve the biggest problem you have. With him gone the entrance you came though is naturally also gone, I am not sure what you will find if you go back but going forward won't be easy, have you not forgotten he spent many years here because he could not go forward. You know, to where all the treasure is."</p>

<p>With the sudden reminder from the skull we had noticed that behind the throne was another tunnel, this one also dark but otherwise clean and clear. Gelfrat threw a rock down the tunnel. Thud. Thud. BANG. The rock was turned to dust from a large bolt of lighting out of one of the walls.</p>

<p>"Otto you first" Gelfrat snickered to himself pointing at me.</p>

<p>"How would that help?" I said back with a frown.</p>

<p>"You're a lightning mage, it won't effect you."</p>

<p>"That was heavenly lightning, pure white." Ditwin said with his mouth wide open.</p>

<p>"You studied other elements?" Nymandus replied a bit shocked.</p>

<p>"I study magical items, ranks, categories, uses and cost. Heavenly objects and how to recognize them is part of the course if only a short lecture as the chances of finding such high ranking items is impossible. Heavenly lightning would be a very clear indication." Ditwin</p>

<p>"So what?" Gelfrat</p>

<p>"Heavenly lightning is not like normal lightning, he would never survive on his own." Ditwin</p>

<p>"What else we suppose to do then?" Gelfrat </p>

<p>"Ahem." The skull said, since really it could not cough. "Yes while walking into that death trap is one option, since the undead are getting out of here somehow in the past there might be another entrance. Nymandus & Tisiel would be our best chance if we take a look around to start."</p>

<p>Everyone started to look around at first, Gelfrat and Ditwin where the first to get bored and go back to throwing stones down the tunnel, in the hopes to find a path? Maybe I was giving them too much credit there. Tisiel took to reading the inscriptions around the room, some on pictures etched into the walls, others etched into the stone at the back of the throne. This is where Nymandus currently was looking down at the stone covered in writing. Reingard stood with Tisiel holding the skull as she wrote.</p>

<p>Tisiel seemed to be having the time of her life, the writing was from the skulls era or so he said. I had to ask so I went over and showed the skull the coins we had found, sure enough they where also from his era. The coins had depictions on one side and symbols on the other. Roughly translated coins had 'Death', 'Seal', & 'Time'. On the flip side the depictions, first the coin from the pyramid had an alter with a man ripping out a heart, this was also where I found the coin inside the pyramid on an alter, the people who had this coin last must of tried to recreate the image on the back. The coin from the king's tomb we dubbed the daughters coin had a stone cut into the shape of a person, I guess with the body buried inside like we saw back in the ruins. and finally the coin from the strange man I found in the forest. On the flip side it had the image of a pyre, a body being layed on a tower of wood and burned.</p>

<p>I sat down on the stone floor to think, if everything here is written in the skulls language, and the man from before is from the same era as the pyramid. One coin was witches study, then the king's tomb must also be from the witches era or later as that was where the key to open the study was found. Then there is 3 more eras between the skulls and the pyramids which he mentioned. Who knows how long he had been locked down there also...</p>

<!-- POV CHANGE? -->

<h4>POV Tisiel</h4>

<p>So the era of the pyramid, those people had found this place last and that means the kings tomb and the witches or any after had not found this place but had found those coins perhaps left behind by the race of people who built the pyramid. Thinking of this each of these groups should have historical names they match up to. "Vortigern, what where the names of the people from each of the eras? I can't believed I never asked..."</p>

<p>"Hmmm, well as you might know each era is home to many different races, tribes, people groups it would be hard to put one name on them so. I mean my people called them selves 'The Immortals' as the best translation but it is not like every sentient race called themselves so." The skull replied while remembering his old life. "Before us we called those people 'The Dao', so my best guess would be to say... Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, ****, ****, ****, Pyramid, Witch, Now. I guess after this expedition I will have to tell you all and others about what happened before, but right now I am also curious about this place as although it was built by my people, I know nothing about it. I am sure this was built by the people who worshiped a death god, and I was not one of theirs."</p>

<p>"Every time I talk to you I feel a headache and more questions then answers.." Tisiel</p>

<p>"Aha well for now, let's just keep working on a way out of here." Skull</p>

<p>"Okay, I can do that much. Reingard why are you holding Vortigern like he will infect you? Hold him normally!" Tisiel</p>

<p>Reingard - "I mean, even if you are a magic item now Vortigern, I still feel like I am holding you severed head. No offence."</p>

<p>Vortigern - "Ahaha, you are not the first to say so, it is fine, honestly this skull is really just the shape the material is not bone at all, to be honest the process was done on my whole body but as you can see it only worked on my head."</p>

<p>"Hey Tisiel, Skull, Reingard." Nymandus called out. "I obviously cannot read any of this script, but it is written in the **** script, it is not the same as the witting on the walls. Just a theory but it was added after to stop the undead from spilling out. I can see the light magic inside it and the death magic spilling out around it, although you cannot see it you should trust me it is as clear as day to me."</p>

<p>"Moving it would require strength..." Reingard said "Otto...?"</p>

<p>The others gave Otto a strange look, only Reingard and myself knew Otto's stat point distribution. While he was clearly not to happy that one of his trump cards was revealed, considering who Ditwin and Gelfrat are they would not take this into account when fighting later, our only real problem was this Nymandus who was far more knowledgeable then we wanted. Even so Otto walked over and pushed against the stone, it did not move at first but eventually it started to move to one side.</p>

<p>After pushing it open, a smell of dead fish wafted up from below. While I am sure it was not fish I cannot think of any other way to describe what that smell was. Otto sitting on the floor a little tired said "I am not that strong, I mean compared to the undead I only have a few points in strength. Why could they not have broken out?"</p>

<p>Nymandus - "The stone had light magic inside, if they touched it. It would of caused them to be pushed back. At least in theory. But since the stone is still here it must of worked."</p>

<p>Skull - "Right well, everyone down I guess, expect. Otto would you mind staying up here? Only that none of us can move the stone and if anything should go wrong or an undead got past us. I think it is best if we seal the stone again behind us and when we come back you will know it is us."</p>

<p>At this request even I had to look down at Vortigern, this was not part of any agreement we had before hand, and what did he mean if it went wrong. If it went wrong the undead being released would not be our biggest worry right then. "Vortigern..."</p>

<p>Vortigern - "It's not just the release of one or two undead, in the past the amount of undead during the end of that era toppled far greater nations then Alden ever was. The academy may be strong, and while I have yet to see the extent of Alden, I have seen how strong each of you are. You are no where near the level students of your age where in the past. Otto, Tisiel and Reingard I can look past since they are younger but for third years to be in the 20's still... It is not bad, but it is not astonishing. What worries me more then that is that Tisiel has informed me that there is no level 100 warriors in Alden."</p>

<p>"Level 100!? What kind of monsters do you expect to find down there!? Even after all this time they should of become weaker..." - Nymandus blurted out of charter for his usual calm self.</p>

<p>Vortigern - "These are undead who threw a far stronger nations into chaos. While controlled undead will lose their power along side their master and even crumble without enough mana to sustain them. True undead, undead born naturally will not decay with time, that is their true threat. They might not be strong, and have various weaknesses but they have time on their side."</p>

<p>Otto looked right at me, before slowly saying "I will wait up here. It must be getting later in the day so I will make a small camp here, I don't think we can return to Linhart in time because of the entrance collapsing so let's say if you are not back in 3 hours I'll assume something went wrong and go get help."</p>

<p>Thinking of his words I couldn't disagree, there is no sun light down here so I am not exactly sure how far in the day it was. I guess since I got excited about all the new things to discover I lost track of time. Being unable to refute what Otto had said we all agreed, we would just take a small look around since Vortigern was so sure there would be high level undead.</p>

<h4>Entering the real tomb, pov Reingard</h4>
<p>It felt wrong leaving Otto behind while the rest of us went ahead with our plan. Although the original plan had been vague enough to account for all the unknowns in the tomb, this one was far more unusual and longer then our previous guesses. It was suppose to be simple, get in, get rid of them and return with the treasures for ourselves. Well, something like that. The planning was done by Tisiel and Otto, I was here for the crazy ride and the pretty girl. Thinking this I just smiled to myself.</p>

<p>"Stop day dreaming. I am depending on you to protect me here." Tisiel looked at me with her big brown eyes and said "Without Otto to hit them while you pin them down I am worried about being able to protect ourselves a little."</p>

<p>"You know I can at least block them from touching you, all you have to do is say so. That will give you enough time to get away, with your brain I am sure you can kill them in some of the traps in any tomb, especially this one." I gave her a small smile, she was too smart for me and would know that I was just trying to cheer her up. Honestly I was hoping we would of just called it quits and set up camp by now.</p>

<p>Once the others had climbed down the hole, Otto closed the stone up behind us and told us to hurry back. Down here was just long dark tunnels. The walls where nothing special, just some kind of brown rock or at least that is how they looked with out mana-lights floating around us.</p>

<p>The paths where weird, they twisted and turned in all random directions with some of them heading up or down at angles impossible for us to follow. It was almost as if some drunk creature had tunneled around forgetting where he was going each time. At the end of the path we had just followed was a dead end with a small pond in the middle, dim lights danced about as flowers and fauna or all colors and shapes grew around the pond. Honestly, it was really peaceful.</p>

<p>"Small we rest here a little then head back to Otto? I mean we only came down for a quick look and with all the possible paths this looks like it will take ages to find what we want." I said to the group.</p>

<p>"This place seems as good as any, I would of thought there would of been more undead down here, I can sense they where here once but in this place there is not anything left lingering..." Nymandus replied.</p>

<p>I figured he must have some way to sense undead by his words. Since he said they had never even come here it must be undead free! I sat up against the wall, and Tisiel came and sat between my legs and led on me as I fed her bits of bread. We were free to act a little more normal now it was getting to the point the others where more of a liability then asset. Also I blerted out that 'There must be a treasure here repelling the undead! Maybe it's in the pond?' which kept Dipshit and Smelly-rat busy probing the pond.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed in unusual bliss considering the situation we were in. Just as I got out some fruits to feed Tisiel, Ditwin had thrown another of his mana stones into the pond to see how deep it was, this time however a small winged creature started to flap its wings as it came out of the pond. It was almost human shaped with two small arts and tiny hands but four legs with no feet coming off its hips. It was a light grey and it's head was huge compared to its stick like body. With tiny black eyes and no eye lids it just hovered there for awhile before opening its mouth, inside it had human teeth, they looked like a human baby's teeth but still they where slightly too big for its large head. Although it's head was large that was only in comparison to its miniscule body. It was a little bizzar looking at this creature smiling at Ditwin.</p>

<p>I felt a tug on my hand and Tisiel said softly under her breath. "That is a tooth fairy."</p>

<p>"Not how I imagined them."</p>

<p>"This is a tooth fairy pond."</p>

<p>"It did come from the pond..."</p>

<p>"We need to run. Fast." Tisiel said while jolting up standing still holding onto my hand tugging at me to come. I ran with her as fast as we could away from the pond area. I took one last look back and saw more grey creatures coming up out of the pond, then as we had gone too far too see back I heard Ditwin and Gelfrat scream bloody murder and then the sounds of them running also.</p>

<p>In our haste we must of taken a wrong turning somewhere because I did not recognize coming this way, but Tisiel said we had to keep running anyway. Until the tooth fairy's gave up we had to escape for now.</p>

<p>"My parents told me tooth fairy's don't attack humans, why are we running? What kind of tooth fairy is that?" I said between panting breaths</p>

<p>"They are harmless most of the time, but when their home is attacked there is no creature who would not defend it. They do not attack us because they can get teeth from us they need and we are not their food, but Ditwin was throwing mana-rocks into their pond of course they would defend themselves. That is why I am saying if we can get away without them seeing us they will calm down and not attack us."</p>

<p>Tisle made sense as always, I do not know if her parents just read her strange stories as a child, taught her well or she was just smart. None of it really mattered. "You're really pretty when you explain things, like you are in your zone." I said without thinking about it too much.</p>

<p>She looked at me and went a little red in the cheeks. I always liked her smart side, like there was nothing in the world she could not figure out given enough time. I went to try and say something else, but before I could Tisle planted a kiss on my lips. "Don't ruin the moment by talking" She said.</p>

<p>All I could do was smile. We had run down so many twists and turns in these dark tunnels I was sure we would be unable to find our way back to Otto anytime today. In fact it was more likely that we would have to spend at least one night down here without him. That suited me just fine. Yeah it was dangerous down here but with Tisiel's smarts we would be fine and we finally get to spend a night without the others for once.</p>

<p>"Hey sweetie, since we are alone..." I tried to say.</p>

<p>"What? Did you forget I was here?" Vortigern said.</p>

<p>"Ah you again, can't we just turn you to face the wall, it's not like you can move."</p>

<p>"First of all, I can still HEAR and that is not how my sight works. Can you not see I have no eyeballs!? It's more a conscious awareness of my surroundings, so no you cannot just FACE ME TO THE WALL." Vortigern snapped back.</p>

<p>At our exchange, Tisiel's face turned bright red. "So every time I put your in the draw back in the academy, you still knew what was happening outside?" Tisiel demanded.</p>

<p>"Err.. Well the first time Reingard came over I thought you two were just going to talk like you and Otto. After that I felt too embarrassed to say anything... So you can see how this is not my fault.." Vortigern replied for the first time a little shy with his words. "It's not like we are even the same species anyway." He carried on digging his own grave.</p>

<p>"YOU!" Tisiel shouted. "I should throw you down a random pit in this tomb!" She threated.</p>

<p>"I approve." I added</p>

<p>"Keep it down, tooth fairy's are not deaf you know." Vortigern muttered.</p>

<p>"Alright, he's not wrong we should keep going a little, at least find a place we can rest, or hide." I turned to look at Tisiel to see if she was tired or could keep going. She nodded back and we headed off further into the tunnels. At first I thought we were walking randomly, but Tisiel soon shared that actually Vortigern had been telling her which direction to go, he said he had a theory and wanted to test it out. Since we had no better alternative she had been following his instructions.</p>

<!-- Switch view for awhile -->
<h4>Back or never left?</h4>
<p>It had been at least 2 hours since they left, maybe more. Without the sun and the sky I was unsure how much time had really passed. If I wanted to there where methods to find out, but if I found out it had only been 10 minutes I think I would really go mad. Not in an angry sort of way, more like ware my pants on my head sort.</p>

<p>I was sat on the stone, back against the reverse of the throne. For awhile I looked down the lightning trapped tunnel ahead for awhile, thinking about ways to get around it, methods to trick it and lastly what would happen if i threw a chicken down there. Would it cook? Or just turn to ash straight away?</p>

<p>After deliberating the important things in life I thought it might be about time to pray for the day.</p>

<p>"It's not a new day, why are you praying already?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what the time is down here, and let's face it there is no one and nothing to do on your end either why don't you tell me about how you ended up like this."</p>

<p>"... I am not here only for your entertainment, if I had a large following I wouldn't be able to answer at all. Even with only you there is still other things to do, I have get things in place for the re-founding of my religion, inform my faction of my return and many other things here in The God Lands."</p>

<p>"I didn't even know there was a God Lands, where it is, what you are even doing this whole time, I just imagined you sitting there alone in a dark void. What faction? You have friends!?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wonder if the Gods of fortune and destiny hate me. Forget about the God Lands there is no reason for a mortal to even know of their existence you can never even visit. Only those with a God level race can, and you are a human, a normal level race. Finally, your joke might be slightly right, they are not my friends but other Gods with the same area of worship, we only work together to avoid being defeated by the Gods with the opposite area of worship." The sentence ended with a bit of a sigh.</p>

<p>"Think of it like this, I am one of the Gods of Death, there are many like me and we fight to be the ruler of Death. However as anyone could guess the Gods of Life are our opposites so we clash often. Our area of worship..."</p>

<p>The explanation was cut short as the sound of foot steps echoed in the room. The foot steps where heavy and making no attempt to hide, with the dull rhythm it was clearly a person with two legs and not some multi legged creature. Since they where making no effort to mask themselves they where not aware I was here, or did not care.</p>

<p>"This will be interesting"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" I asked inside my head.</p>

<p>"You'll see, I need to prepare something just encase, you are on your own for a bit." And with that he left the connection between us felt empty as if he let go of the rope between our minds.</p>

<p>The sound of the steps stopped for a moment behind me, they resumed again shortly after and I saw the figure walk past me towards the tunnel ahead. If it was possible for my eyes to pop out of my head they would of. Linhart walked past me towards the tunnel. I wanted to warn him about the tunnel but my mind was too busy reeling from this information.</p>

<p>Would it even work on him if he's dead? Do the undead get effected by the traps?</p>

<p>Just then Linhart kicked one of the stones down the tunnel. The lightning went off and turned it to ash. "Good thing Ditwin is predictable, the ash marks on the floor shows the traps still work. Where you not going to warn me Otto?" He turned to look at me sat on the stone behind the throne.</p>

<p>"I thought you died." Was all I could reply.</p>

<p>"I did too, but no. Turns out that tower was a training ground for some mad man's apprentices. It just makes you start over again from the bottom." Linhart replied slowly. "I spent age fighting some kind of tentacle monster on the bottom floor before the tower just disappeared and now here I am."</p>

<p>"The others went ahead, under this rock and made me wait behind to help them out once they come back from exploring shortly. The plan was to spend the night in here, but I think we should head back the entrance and get all of our supplies, I think we are running around without realising the day is long over and soon the exhaustion will catch up." I said while keeping ahold of the connection in my mind, waiting for him to come back.</p>

<p>"Mmm, I had wondered if you would of come back, but none of you did so I brought the supplies with me. Just encase. I was bound to run into you all if i kept moving forward anyway. So we can just camp here, no need to go back." Linhart said while looking at the rock I sat on. "So the others are under that rock? Sometimes you say the dumbest lies. TELL ME THE TRUTH, ARE THE OTHERS THE ASH PILES IN THE TUNNEL?" He roared at the end.</p>

<p>"No, you guessed right the first time, those are Ditwin's rocks. You know that." I did not move a muscle, I knew what he wanted. Revenge. Suddenly he pulled out a short staff, about the length of his forearm and hand. On top of the staff was a small fireball covering the end. He pointed it in my direction and said "You are not even level 20 yet, perhaps I should teach you the difference is not just stat points, some of my skills are level 2. You know your strength stat seems pretty high, I bet your charisma stats are rock bottom. Stand up."</p>

<p>I was not sure what he meant by my charisma stat being rock bottom, why did that matter? I was going to do as he asked anyway while he had that thing pointed at me, but I felt more compelled to stand up, almost like my body wanted to before my mind. I soon found myself backed against the lightning tunnel.</p>

<p>"They really under the rock?" Linhart was looking right into my eyes.</p>

<p>"There is a tunnel under the rock, it's not a normal rock. Nymandus said it contained the power of life and holds back the undead under it so that's why we had to close it back up behind them and I had to wait behind. No one else was strong enough." I told the truth, although my body felt weird, like I had to.</p>

<p>"Walk down that tunnel" he motion with his chin.</p>

<p>"I'd die." I replied. Glad my body was not fighting back on that one.</p>

<p>"Seems like my charisma stat is not that high then. Walk down there or i'll blast you anyway. You're a lightning mage, so you should be fine." He smiled a half smile at his own words.</p>

<p>I could charge him, but I would be blasted before I got there. At least I would die trying. I grabbed the connection in my mind and did the best I could to ask for any kind of help, I was going to die. Along with it his first disciple since coming back, and if I died down here, with the academy still looking over his old temple with only professors it would be unlikely he could make a come back anytime soon.</p>

<p>"Well? Do you want to burn?" Linhart was clearly on a short fuse.</p>

<p>*Ting* The menu appeared in front of me. New Quest: Insult Linhart. Difficulty: Godly. Reward: Change Class #$!"%&.</p>

<p>That quest... The difficulty seemed so wrong, but the reward was it broken or did he let a cat chose the name? Most importantly. What the hell is he doing!? How is this helpful!? I breathed out heavily. "I'm going just let me pray one last time you inbreed piss pot."</p>

<p>"If you were not about to die, I would kill you for that." Linhart sneered.</p>

<p>I did not care. Quest complete. Will you accept the class change to #$!"%&?</p>

<p>Just then. "Accept it. The spelling is on purpose, if anyone knew I had this class I would be hunted down. Let along that I gave it to a mortal. We might have to go our separate ways for awhile after this until you are strong enough. I wanted to make you my champion in this era but looks like you will have to find me another. I trust you to tell no one. Just don't die here." With that the connection was gone. Not unattended. Gone.</p>

<p>He was still the God I had listed but it seemed like he wanted to hide that as much as possible now. All I could do was accept.</p>

<p>Before I did Linhart had blasted me in the back with a fireball. I went flying into the tunnel as I accepted. *Ting* *Ting* *Ting* *Ting* *Ting* The sound kept going off in my head, all I could see was white lightning coming closer.</p>

<h4>Nymandus</h4>
<p>After seeing Ditwin and Gelfrat being over run by tooth fairies of all things. These creatures are not taught about until the 2nd year, so how Tisiel and Reingard knew to run before we did, I do not know. Maybe they where looking for any excuse to run away from Ditwin.</p>

<p>Needless to say once I realised what they where and what was going on I also ran out of the tunnels. By the time I reached the first fork Tisiel and Reingard had long gone. My original mission given to me by my tutor was to slay a level 30+ undead monster, that is the only reason we had permission to leave as it was. With that still in my mind I ran down the tunnel with the strongest rejection of my light element. So far this place has had only low level undead like most tombs, I was surprised to find the magic skull say there would be high level undead down here, I might be able to complete my quest and get back sooner then I had expected. Maybe that is why I rushed down here without proper rest. I feel that now, I am tired.</p>

<p>After awhile of running and now walking. My legs hurt. There seemed to be no end to this tunnel and the rejection of my light element seemed to only be getting stronger. If I can complete my mission and get back to the academy before the others I can report this place to my tutor before the rest of the academy finds out, along with the information about the magic skull. Who knows he might recommend me to be an apprentice of the champion of light. Then even if I am unlucky I will still become one of the strongest undead hunters in Alden.</p>

<p></p>
<h4>Ditwin</h4>
<p>I had just thrown a mana-rock into the pond when a bunch of freak looking flies came out and started to bite onto me. Easily enough to fix, I wrapped my whole body rock-mana and they can bite into that all they want. I turned to see Gelfrat trying to help by shotting them off me with his water only to start screaming when they bit into him.</p>

<p>He kept screaming, I turned to get help from Nymandus but he had already run off like a coward, his true colors showed when it mattered. I knew we should of stayed with Linhart, we should get back to him. I shot mana-rocks at all the fucking flies I could see trying to get to Gelfrat. He was covered in bites from head to toe, chunks of flesh missing from various places, with a really obvious part missing from his cheek.</p>

<p>"Run you moron, they are going to rip you apart." I shouted though my rock form. I grabbed hold of his arm and dragged him away as he shot rocks and water behind us. The little flies followed us out into the tunnels.</p>

<p>All we could do was keep running, trying to remember which way we came from. Luckily after running down a few of the tunnels they stopped and started to move back, some stayed around unwilling to come any further forward. It must of been the light stone at the other end, they must be pushed away by the light magic. Just have to get back to where that first year is and get out of here and find Linhart.</p>

<p>Since the flies had left us alone, we walked deeper into the tunnel area. "You'll be fine, we are going back the throne room, we can use healing potions there." I told Gelfrat.</p>

<p>Gelfrat did not reply. Maybe the hole in his cheek did not help but he seemed to be a lot quieter then normal. I put him down on the side of the tunnel to rest. Maybe we did not have time to get back to the throne room, seems further away then I remembered. I got out one of the health potions from my inventory.</p>

<p>"You should be use to it by now, but fair warning this will sting." I poured the liquid inside onto his wounds and tried to get him to drink the last of it. I could hear him try to complain about the pain again but his throat must of been screamed sore. The only noises that escaped his mouth where poor whimpers.</p>

<p>I sat down next to him for awhile, trying to keep him company. I thought about carrying him the rest of the way but I had to keep guard over him.</p>

<p>Eventually Gelfrat stood up, he started to walk off down the tunnel holding his stomach and face. I stood up and walked after him as he turned to see if I was coming. Before I could even process what was happening in my mind let alone shout out a dark flash came out of the darkness, a zombies hand and smashed into the side of Gelfrat's head. He slammed into the wall on the side, blood spraying along the tunnel as his body slumped down against the wall without a head.</p>

<p>I wanted to scream, undo what happened, wake up. None of those things happened though, as if by automatic response I shot mana rock towards the zombie and covered myself in rocks. Before the transformation finished something stung my neck, and I crushed it with the rocks. A small bug.</p>

<p>The zombie was surrounded by bugs, they where all over the place, but I was safe under the rocks, they seemed to have no defence at all and just squashed from any light touch.</p>

<p>I wanted to get Gelfrat back, I know he's dead but maybe I can do something? Anything? I shot rocks at the zombie, and the insects landed on me but they could do nothing as I swatted at them. The zombie did not move back at all when the first rock slammed into him, in fact it just rolled off him like I had shot the rock at the wall.</p>

<p>I am sorry Gelfrat. I ran.</p>

<!-- Ditwin burns to death with the feeling of cold fleeing after gelfrat death, gelfrat is smashed into a wall by an undead, tisle runs off with Reingard and the skull goes to the bridge where the skull sees no gap but the others do because he's dead. After otto goes into the lightning tunnel Linhart goes out of the exit after watching ditwin die.-->
<!-- <h4>Gelfrat - Swap with Ditwin?</h4> -->

<h4>Linhart</h4>
<p>Huh, I never killed anyone before. Even after seeing that kid get blasted by the lightning the force of my fireball sent him to the other end of the tunnel, although he must be a pile of ash by now. He deserved it for tricking me on the bridge back there. If the others found out what happened I would of become a joke, now without him here there is no one to refute me. Weird though, the elders always told me the first time you kill someone it's very common to feel sick. I guess common means it's not certain.</p>

<p>I walked over the stone he was sat on earlier. If the others where underneath it would save me the time to just wait here if what he said was true. As I was walking there, my body felt cold, shivering like a ghost had passed though me, my stomach roiled and turned inside. Then I vomited. Bent over holding my stomach as its contents emptied onto the stone floor. Guess I had a common reaction after all.</p>

<p>over a quarter of an hour later I was sat on the throne. My insides felt hollow, since I had mostly meal pills and not real food there was not much to bring up. Still, it was a horrible feeling. Don't even regret my actions, just kind of wish he fought back and I killed him in combat. Bit of sad first kill.</p>

<p>A weird sound came out from behind me, I turned and saw nothing. It sounded like Ditwin to me, although muffled. I went over to the stone behind the throne and tried to push it a side but it would not move even a little. Strength was a stat for people who wanted to die up close anyway, I would just use my mana to move it. I put the cloth bag of black powder inside a gap in the stone and set it on fire and jumped back. I had got it from a professor while studying the uses of fire element under him, he was assured with this powder he could find a way to make the fire element the dominant element in battle but as of now .... BANG ... It could just make small explosions.</p>

<p>To my surprise the rock barely moved! The thing was heavier then I thought, must be some kind of magic interaction I am not aware of. I peered down the small gap created when the stone moved during the explosion, even more embarrassing the rock was still solid nothing had broken off. That professor had a long way to go. I could see though into the darkness and waited for my eyes to adjust.</p>

<p>"Ditwin? Is that you? Why are you alone and covered in rocks?" I asked into the darkness.</p>

<p>"It burns! let me out. Let me out. I am so cold. It's coming. Let me out." He pleaded, I had never seen him in such a state before, Ditwin was not the kind of person to plead with anyone about anything. Hot and cold? Had he gone mad. "I can't move the rock easily, hold on I need to find a metal bar or something." I told him.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me to die. I .... AHRHAGHAHHGHGH" I saw his body get pulled back a little into the darkness and chunks of rocks, blood and flesh spread all over the place. "Crap." I started to shove the rock shut with my feet kicking it as hard as I could and blasting it with fireballs after. I don't know if it shut fully, because I ran away. I was going back to the academy to let them know what happened!</p>

<h4>Tisiel (& Reingard)</h4>
<p>It felt like we had followed Vortigern's directions for half the night because my legs where killing me. The pain was just shotting up and down my legs from the ache. I wanted to at least spend some time with Reingard alone but Vortigern just had to ruin that, at least if we are going somewhere that somewhere we would still be alone, kind of. Maybe with a group of undead around us, but still.</p>

<p>Waking from my walking day dream, I noticed we had reached a large set of black doors, Or at least they looked black with the little light we had. They where at least 20 meters high with large handles hanging from the middle like this was built for a giant. "Vortigern, do you know where we are?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I was a little stunned myself. These doors are from my time, when I was alive I mean. The style and size are reflective of only our kind back when we ruled." He replied.</p>

<p>"What, your skull is the same size as ours, yet your bodies where tall enough to need door like this?" I asked, sure he was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Long story, but yes we were much bigger then you, and my skull was shrunk during the process of refining a magical item strong enough to last the process. Everything was bigger back then and the air was different then it was now. Anyway the important part here is I can open the doors." After which he spoke some strange words and the doors started to open by themselves. "In we go. I am sure of where we are now."</p>

<p>Fine keep your riddles, you'll have to tell me later I thought stepping inside past the doors, as we walked though the doors kept opening slowly. inside was giant reception desk inside a stone wall, like a take away shop in the academy. The desk was entirely empty, would of been weirder if it was not honestly.</p>

<p>As we went inside more, we walked around the reception desk and heard a huge BANG. The doors had finished opening. Inside was rows and rows of swords, armor, shields and other items all lined up on display on ranks and manakins. "Vortigern, is this, the treasure room?" I asked gently.</p>

<p>"It was a shop or armory, the treasure room would be in the back. It's still the best place to go other then the library but I can tell you where we are now. Or rather what we are inside of." He said.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know." I replied moving between the items. They had tags next to them, not in the language of the symbols I translated but Vortigern's language. Since we had spent more time on the pyramid language I was unable to read these. "Also what do the tags say?" I added.</p>

<p>"Hmm? Oh they are item descriptions, your ability to identify items is uncommon today, but back in my time it was one in a million, these tags helped us to know what the item did without extensive testing every time. I'll translate them later. We are right now inside one of my kins bodies, although blown up in size, the opposite of how I shrunk, his body was used as a tomb to house whoever was important enough to require a tomb of this grander where his followers would take up residence in the tomb to protect his resting place. This is actually my first time inside one of these kinds of tombs but I read about them a lot. The tunnels back there should of been made out of the passages within his brain." He explained.</p>

<p>"Number one, eww. Number two, the pyramid also had his followers buried with him, was that your influence?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Number one, this was not a normal burial but set aside for only the greatest of us so show some respect. Number two, no, many cultures have similar traditions but the pyramid was statues, where the ashes of the flowers where added later they where not buried with him." He answered.</p>

<p>I turned to see Reingard and ask him to help me collect the treasures around here, but I saw he was half way though grabbing the helmet off one of the giant statues... I burst out laughing. "Leave the giant items, and just take the smaller stuff, once we grabbed as much of that as we can we are going to the treasure room and library. If we have room left we can come back for these things. Magic items only shrink down to fit the users if you can equip them so they won't shrink and take up too much room." I explained to him.</p>

<p>"Your parents are archeologists right? Not grave robbers?" He questioned back with a small smile.</p>

<p>I could only give him a smile back. There was a thin line between the two since items found in tombs of other civilizations and especially old eras could turn out to be great treasures of today! Or in some cases worthless like the time my mother found a spy glass that lets you look at objects so close that it no longer resembles the object you are looking at...</p>

<p>"Vortigern, do you think any of these pieces we have missed are worth taking with us?" I asked quickly before we moved on.</p>

<p>"Everything in this room would of been a great treasure back then. The problems that the enchantments might of decayed, there could be a race restriction or in some cases like the ring of storage in your hand, a very rare and useful enchantment in my time, I remember we the immortals where obsessed with these rings, but erm well. Now you have your inventory the demand for this item has made it very cheap today. It acts as a second inventory, a place to store things. Since you can store 10 items per level even a low level has vast storage space as it is today." He rambled on some more but gave no indication that any of the items in here really stood out as worth anything crazy today.</p>

<p>While he was talking about all the different items we passed along I made my way to the treasure vault. It was another large door, although this one was one quatre the size of the last one, maybe this was a single person door for these giants. At some point Vortigern always left more questions then answers running around my head and I feel like it would take a life time or two to find out everything he knew. I'll get rich first and then write books on what he knows.</p>

<p>"Vortigern, hate to interrupt, but could you open the door?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh. Well you see this tomb was built by the death faction and I was part of the third fact of balance so I don't have the means to open this particular vault." He replied mater of fatly.</p>

<p>I could feel my eye brow twitch. "Then why did you bring us to this door?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well I just thought you would of wanted to know with your interest in history and all." He replied a little confused.</p>

<p>I could not fault him for that. It was true. But what about the money...</p>

<p>"You immortals sure where cleaver, but like the others you also died out. There must be a way around these mechanisms, a fault in your technology?" A voice came from the back of the weapons room.</p>

<p>"Ah the old band is back together." Vortigern said without me even turning him around. I guess it is true his eye socks mean nothing in terms of sight.</p>

<p>"Otto!" Reingard said walking over to give him a big hug. It looked like those two have been getting closer without me. "How did you get here?" Reingard asked.</p>

<p>He pointed to what looked like the the same doors we came though except they where completely white and at the opposite end. "Linhart pushed me though the lightning tunnel this is where it came out." He replied.</p>

<p>"He WHAT!?" I was stunned, Linhart was not dead? He tried to kill Otto? And it didn't kill him!?</p>

<p>Hugging Reingard with one arm Otto carried on his questioning, "So your technology had flaws right?"</p>

<p>"Well, erm, fine, yes. It was not perfect, you see we were always following and chasing after the true meaning of the Dao and to that end we developed most of our technology based on that left behind by the people in the era of the Dao but never really catching up in all areas. That means that despite our best effects there are flaws. Now the Dao era..." Vortigern tried to continue but Otto interrupt again.</p>

<p>"What flaws? Since you are here Nymandus & Dipshit & Rat-face could come at any moment, and there is back from the dead Linhart to deal with. So please." Otto asked.</p>

<p>"Okay, okay. There are several methods to breaking most immortal arrays but you have to know they are very rare. Our main nemesis throughout the whole era was heavenly lightning which would occasionally just drop down with no reason and strike us. There were the immortal fires of hell, the void and..." Before Vortigern could go on listing off impossible ingredients that have long since disappeared from this earth he was interrupted again.</p>

<p>"Lightning, got it." Otto walked up to the door and pressed his hand against it.</p>

<p>"Not any lightning, heavenly lightning. It's not the same thing at ...." And mid speech he became speechless, and I became slack jawed as the door just swung open easily with Otto's hand.</p>

<p>He turned to look at us three standing there confused and slack jawed. "My teacher specializes in types of lightning, heavily seemed to be his favorite. While it is lost from this earth, the Gods possess it and can grant it to mortals. When they feel like it." Otto said and shrugged.</p>

<p>"What kind of God has to spare power to hand out heavenly lightning to open doors!?" Vortigern said.</p>

<p>"One with no other followers." Otto retorted as he stepped inside the treasure room.</p>

<p>"Fine, keep your secrets." Vortigern said after him.</p>

<p>Once I stepped inside I found myself surrounded by gems from the roof to the floor. Reds, greens, blues, purples, pinks, oranges, the list would be never ending. "Spirit jades, spirit stones." Vortigern said. "Among many others. They where used by immortals to become more powerful quickly. Maybe of no use to you."</p>

<p>I grabbed one from near by and tried to identify it. *Ding* *Jade* Not sure if it was because it was just ordinary jade or because the skill failed because my level in it was so low. I put it back a little disappointed. "Jade is a precious material, but its not magical. What do you wanna do Reingard?" I asked.</p>

<p>"One or two might not take up much room, but there is thousands at least. It might be better to take one of the magical weapons back and hope the enchantment is useful or there is no race restrictions." He replied earnestly.</p>

<p>"Urgh, this tomb was suppose to make us rich." I complained.</p>

<p>"There is more armor back here." Otto shouted from up ahead. I got a little excited and bound down past the jewels and saw Otto stood before a set of black and red leather armor, boots and arm guards. To his left where 4 other sets of armors and mounted behind them higher up was one last set. Each set had stone tablet tags along side them so we asked Vortigern to translate them all for us.</p>

<!-- magicarcher.jpg -->

<p>"Starting from the right, with the black and red set. It say's here it is infused with the element of fire in each of the pieces, a different skill is attached would be the best way to translate this I think. There is no stat buff on any piece, and let me just add that magic items with skills are rare today but in the time off immortals is basically unheard of outside of royal circles. There is a brief description of each skill but if the armor even contains useable fire elements after all this time let alone is a skill I am not sure." Vortigern explained as Otto stared on with a blank face. Knowing him he just liked the look of the armor once he finds out it cannot help him he will lose interest if another piece suits him better. Vortigern went on to explain the other three pieces in a similar manner. They where earth, water, metal and wood.</p>

<p>As for the final set of armor up on high, it was pure black in color and was said to contain the death element. The black from each armor set was to show their allegiance to the king of death, who would wear the final set. "I would hazard a guess that if we were to travel to the school of light they would as well have similar sets in white." Vortigern added. "This being just a theory, because these elements made up the most important elements to us at the time, think of these sets more as honorary ranks. It is likely they date back to the age of the DAO rather then my own age. I don't know if I mentioned before I came from a third faction outside of these two so my knowledge was limited at the time and not much greater now. My faction had similar sets of mixed white and black in color as a show of balance."</p>

<p> After his explanation I tried to identify each set. All I could see was question marks which was both good news and bad. Good news is they still contained at the very least trace amounts of mana. Bad news was, how much, did they still have skills inside? Was this just junk? Would they be restricted by race?</p>

<p>"Tisiel's thoughts are almost audible" Otto side to Reingard to my side as I was working. I puffed up my face and stared at them both and responded with, "If you know what I am thinking how about helping?"</p>

<p>"I want the red one, Reingard?"</p>
<p>"The silver one, metal remember? Or did you forget again?" Reingard replied with a cocky smile. "Looks like lightning was not one of the chosen."</p>
<p>"Chosen? Lightning was our nemesis!" Vortigern interjected.</p>

<p>"I can pick the all black death one right?" I asked kind of hoping it was on the table also.</p>

<p>"It still only counts as one." Otto replied with a shrug and looked at Reingard.</p>

<p>"That leaves earth, water and wood." Reingard said.</p>
<p>"Any preference?" I asked to them both.</p>
<p>"Earth, counters Otto's lightning." Reingard said laughing to himself.</p>
<p>"Water, I don't want the green one." I said smiling at Otto.</p>
<p>Otto just shrugged. "I'll only end up selling which ever to you two later." With that he stored it away. Then started to strip off!</p>

<p>"What are you doing!?"</p>
<p>"Putting it on, I wanna try it out. Don't you?" Otto replied like I was the crazy one!</p>
<p>He had a point though, I wanted to see if the skills still worked. "Okay but you two get out of here, and take Vortigern with you." I threw him to Reingard.</p>
<p>"Don't understand why I have to leave." Reingard complained on his way out. "I don't understand why you are both so moody, I am not even the same species as you two." Vortigern added.</p>

<p>With them gone I tried on the black outfit. Black leather boots, leather top and leather arm guards that went over my hands as gloves and over my shoulders, on top of them was metal guard plate layers falling down my arm like scales. My black skirt with dark gold patterned hem and black long socks fitted nicely with the outfit. I equipped my small bags over the top and I was done.</p>

<p>I could feel the mana moving from me and throughout the armor, there was only 3 pieces in total and it felt like part of it was missing although I could not explain it. I could only put it down to there was no head gear or weapon to match. If it was an outfit for the ruler of death maybe there should of been a crown?</p>

<p>I tried to move my mana into the arms to see if any skills would activate, but no matter what I tried it seemed like either I did not have enough mana or maybe the pieces where defective after all it has been ... 7 maybe 8 eras since it was made. Most of my other equipment was accessories though so it did not hurt my combat capability to keep it on.</p>

<p>I went outside to see the others.</p>

<p>Otto had black leather boots with metal in places dyed with red as a second color, his black baggy trousers under with a black leather armor onto, with red trim and in the middle a red 8 pointed shape that was not quite a star. In the middle was a fire pattern in gold. On his arms where wrapped looking arm guards with red woven throughout.</p>

<p>Reingard was starting to look more like a prince, with his outfit being black leather throughout but on top and sometimes peeking though patches in the leather was sparking silver plates. It was not real silver but it looked like it was but something much stronger. He held in his left hand a shield made of his metal mana. Curiously we all had three parts each with no head or weapon.</p>

<p>"Hey Tisiel, could you look at some of my old items? I think they got damaged in the lightning. I want to check if its worth keeping them." Otto asked handing over a pair of black boots.</p>

<p>I scanned them and the first thing I saw was the items new name. "Ruined boots." I wouldn't have to look any further to see that they where now useless. He the got out a pair of black burnt gloves which I knew to be brown in the past and a deformed metal pole. I just shook my head at him and told him it was not worth assessing.</p>

<p>"So did either of you get the skills to work at all?" I asked.</p>

<p>Reingard moved his shield to the side and showed me silver metal crawling all over his outfit until he was covered in silver all below his neck. "I don't know how strong it is but Otto couldn't dent it with his ...Is that your warhammer?" Reingard asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It was. I am a little worn out after being electrocuted a thousand times so maybe that was not the best test, but yeah, seems like an armor skill." Otto said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, looks really useful! I couldn't get mine to work at all." I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know how the other two work, so maybe they are like mine and need to keep trying them out in different situations?" Reingard smiled trying to cheer me up.</p>

<p>"Did you get yours to work?" I asked to Otto.</p>

<p>Otto stared at me, not saying anything. I was confused then saw smoke coming from under his boots and he stepped away and the floor was on fire. "Not sure how useful setting myself a little bit on fire under my shoes will be in combat but it's fun." He said as if he was not bothered by what just happened.</p>
<!-- gloves, adds fire to a weapon. boots, change the surface to fire. chest, reflect damage as fire when hit in melee-->

<p>I was a little frustrated that they both at least gone some level of the skills to work while I could not, but like Reingard it was very likely they where situational skills and I should be happy to even have on piece of equipment with a skill on let alone a set. If they have a set bonus effect for wearing more pieces then it would be priceless.</p>

<p>After cheering myself up a bit I asked Vortigern if he would know how to take us to the library or anywhere else useful. Even with what we have already it might be a good idea to leave and inform the academy of the location of the tomb and sell what we have. Though my parents of course there is no way I am letting the academy get their hands on these. They would not pay us at all.</p>

<p>We set off back into the tunnels with Vortigern leading us.</p>
<!-- spring loaded coffin lol -->

<p>I had put a point into magic already, and acquired one spell from the new class. It felt wrong, like the display was for someone elses and mine would come back any moment. I want to believe it was because the lightning damaged it in some way. Seeing that faith had N/A next to it though, it must of had something to do with the worst God ever.</p>

<p>I hope the other don't notice that strong wind would break me right about now, I need to get out of here really, but even if I leave alone I won't make it back in this condition.</p>

<p>We had opted to walk straight back and try and locate if there was a library according to the layout of previous tombs Vortigern had studied. We stopped and slept when we could in turns and just all rested awake other times. It was hard to keep track of how much time had really passed.</p>

<p>Eventually we came to a place Vortigern was sure should be the location of the library in other tombs. Again with large double doors that he opened in his own language. Inside however, did not look like a library. The place was a mess unlike the armory, burn marks, holes in walls and nothing but ash and oversized bones scatted about the place.</p>

<p>"How is this place such a huge mess, but the armory was left almost spotless. There was not even any dust inside there!" Tisiel demanded to know.</p>

<p>"Are you asking me? I've been very clear and upfront that I have never been down here before. I only know a rough way around because the layouts of these tombs cannot vary too much since they are built within a body, and I have studied the anatomy of immortals." Vortigern replied.</p>

<p>"Hmph! So this was a waste..." Tisiel let out a long sigh.</p>

<!-- <p>I am so tired, not sleepy but tired. Maybe we should of been working on leaving but I guess greed got a dark grip around my heart. We walked around the library for a little while before deciding on leaving.</p> -->

<p>Me and Reingard decided to look around the library for awhile, Tisiel waited by the entrance. She claimed just encase but clearly she was very frustrated, we had been down here for days, tired and her skills did not work right away. Still I was still over the moon about the set that I got.</p>

<p>Reingard soon gave up his light search of kick over near by objects and checking what was nearby and headed over to Tisiel. I decided it would be nice if they had some alone time so I took Vortigern with me to look down the other tunnel we passed by on the way here.</p>

<p>"So, question i've had on my mind for a long time. We found you in some kind of study right? What was that place?" I asked to pass the time.</p>

<p>"Ah, did you learn the story witch of Alden? It was a story Tisiel taught me, well long story short it was her study after she discovered the gate way to this land, the portal you came though near Brandenburg." Vortigern replied.</p>

<p>"Did not see that coming you where with the Witch... Tisiel was saying something before about all of the locations having something to do with death? Did she die there?" I carried on the conversation.</p>

<p>"Ah no no no, it was just her study, she found the coin in a tomb along with myself and she spent some time studying this land and history before leaving and well I guess the story is about what she did after she left me behind in that study."</p>

<p>"So left me run this by you again, the Immortals made this tomb, sealed it with coins and then they where passed down though the eras until being left behind in tombs and forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Are you just making small talk? Yes we often sealed things with coins, they are easily stored and you can decorate them. Whats wrong with that? Well it is not like I was allowed access to everything in every era but they mostly used this place to store things and the coins where kept by the people in charge of protecting them. I guess when their era's end and there was no one to pass the coins onto it just kind of stayed with them. "</p>

<p>After that I stopped trying to make small talk, I guess I am not very good at making small talk since he called me out on it. For a person who has livid longer then everyone else I guess he is bored of small talk.</p>

<p>At the end of the tunnel was a single stone coffin. Nothing else was around and the only light source I had was a mana-ball Reingard stuck to me after I told him I was low on mana. I don't have that spell anymore.</p>

<p>I looked around although I am not too sure why. I grabbed aside of the stone lid and before I could push I was interrupted.</p>

<p>"What are you doing? That is clearly a coffin. You know where dead people are kept." Vortigern said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, he's dead, but what if he has something useful in there to keep me alive?" I replied and tried to push the lid off then remembered that I currently have no strength at all. I let out a sigh remembering what happened.</p>
<!-- Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, ****, ****, ****, Pyramid, Witch, Now. -->
<p>I walked back to the ground I left Vortigern on near by when suddenly the stone lid of the coffin shot off and flew off down the tunnel with a bang. A skeleton rose up from the coffin.</p>

<p>I turned around ready to run, that scared the hell out of me and I no way I could fight this giant skeleton! However it did not move.</p>

<p>"AHAHAHAHAHAHA" Vortigern actually burst out laughing. "Oh wow I have not seen that one in years! Your face! Oh wow."</p>

<p>"What? What is this?" I yelled</p>
<p>"Ah it is a classic joke my people pulled on each other. It is a coffin set up with spring magic I guess you could say. It is a prank to scare people. I haven't seen it since I first joined my sect all those years ago." Vortigern kept laughing like this was the funniest thing in the world.</p>

<p>"Your people where weird? You know that?" I walked off holding the laughing skull back to Tisiel. I did not have the heart to even look in the coffin anymore.</p>

<p>I threw the laughing skull back to Tisiel. "Please never leave me alone with him again, I am convinced he knew what was going to happen."</p>

<p>"Huh? What happened? You look like a ghost." Tisiel asked.</p>
<p>I just shock my head. "Let's get out of here." I walked off down the tunnel and they soon followed after. We traveled for only a few hours before coming across a sight we did not think we would find.</p>

<p>We found blood all over the walls, the floor. Pieces of arm and legs organs, the size made it clear that it was a human and a fresh one.</p>

<p>I moved slightly closer to the mess, Reingard walked up ahead and picked up something from one of the pieces. "It's Nymandus." he said.</p>

<p>"How did he even end up here, let alone die. His element was strong against the undead." Tisiel pointed out.</p>

<p>"Are we pushing forward?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Are you mad? Turn and run already. He was far stronger then any of you." Vortigern replied.</p>

<p>I turned to run, but then I saw behind Tisiel, a mixture of shadow and bone. I am not sure what it once was with three arms, some rib bones but nothing below and no face. The shadows moved and filled in the rest, falling over each other to hold it up. String of what was cloth hanging between the bones at peeps between the folding shadows.</p>

<p>No one needed to tell me to run this time. Although the only direction was in which lay Nymandus dead body the other would soon be my resting place if I went that way. Reingard ran past me to grab Tisiel as she sprinted towards me leading the way down the tunnel. We did not get too far before another fork in the tunnels, I took the left one without hesitation and as soon as I had run though the bones on the ground I missed rose up. With the strange shadows grabbing at them pulling them into shape.</p>

<p>Tisiel and Reingard ran right away from the forming skeletons and down that tunnel. Where we just tricked by undead? I didn't know they could be intelligent on their own.</p>

<p>F... That is the grade I would give myself for this pigs dinner. I kept running. What else could I do? I was not going to turn and fight. I shot though the tunnels as fast as I could. The tunnel I took had a slight up slope to it, if this really was inside the skull of a dead immortal I could only guess that going up would only lead me into his skull. A dead end. Maybe Tisiel and Reingard where going in the direction of the exit.</p>

<p>I couldn't keep running like this, I was going to collapse any moment. As soon as I slowed down one of the three skeletons I could see shot a bone from his hand like a spear and it went though my right leg. It did not slow down at all and pierced all the way though the other-side and stuck into the ground.</p>

<p>I screamed loud and fell to my side. In a panic I shot out the only spell I had 'Lightning seeds'. In the past this was a faith spell I had been given to use once a day. Now that my class had been changed to Kʼawiil it seemed this was his spell and I was able to learn it like a normal spell.</p>

<p>'Lightning seeds - Shoots a group of '1' seeds in a spread from the user. The seeds attach to opponent(s) and cause lightning damage over time. A part of the damage is used to restore your as mana.' The description was very different then when it was given to me as a faith spell, I guess it was because it was not his spell to give but whoever Kʼawiil was.</p>

<p>The 'seeds' was just one seed, I think because it was the level 1 version of the spell. The ball of cackling lighting in the form of a seed stuck into the closest one. Since it was mostly made of shadows it stuck into the shadow and started to cause damage and sap mana from it into me. The damage must of been easily shrugged off but the skeleton seemed to have a bad reaction to it and stopped trying to grab at it inside of its own shadows making up its body.</p>

<p>My mana recovered after one moment, the damage might of been small but so was my amount of mana. It seemed like because they where made of these shadows nad just using the skeletons as armor my seed was having a strange reaction causing my mana to shoot up.</p>

<p>I shot another seed at the next one, then the final skelton. While my mana was almost drained from each shot it quickly recovered, the cool down for the spell should of taken me longer to cast then this. Something was unusual about this place but as long as I could stay alive I won't question it. I reached into my inventory and grabbed at some healing potions and started to pour them directly onto my leg and drink them. I got up soon after and limped away while the skeletons where busy grabbing at themselves but failing because the seed was moving with the follow of the shadows.</p>

<p>I hobbled off into the darkness, the light on Reingard manaball had gone, maybe I was too far away from them now. I felt my way along the wall, the grinding screams coming from behind me. I felt my way along the cave wall the bumps with my hands cutting my fingers but I had to keep going and then I felt smooth wood. It was a door, although I am not sure what kind as it was completely dark.</p>

<p>I tried grabbing for a door handle or someway to open it, I pushed into it but nothing, so I felt around the door for anything. Maybe it was not a door. Then I noticed it had gone quiet again. The skeletons where not playing around with the seeds any more, the effect had worn off, why was it so fast!?</p>

<p>I reached around and found a small bump in the wood, it was metal and smooth. It felt curved over like the back end of a pin inside the wood, I couldn't grip at it with my fingers the nails kept slipping. They where getting closer, I could hear their bones clattering against each other as the shadows shambled their way to me. I gripped at it and pulled but my fingers slipped again, this can't be the right way. I hope it's a door. The skeletons where close, I could hear them speed up. I punched the damn thing out of frustration and it moved into the wood a little. Great, now I won't get that out.</p>

<p>I went to try and grab at it again, but my hand met the air instead of wood and I felt face forward. It had opened somehow? I scrabbled to stand up as they had made it close enough that I could hear them right next to to me. I swung my body and tried to slam the door shut, but it hit into one of the skeletons so I slammed it again. And again. And again. Click. The door fell into place. I felt a warm liquid fall down my face.</p>

<p>With all of my adrenaline up I did not notice that he had scratched across my head, and it was bleeding fast. I slumped to the ground as the sound of the wood being scratched and hit on the otherwise. I had to use more health potions already, my HP was in danger. I took a quick look at the system and saw that I was down to 12% hp left.</p>

<p>As the healing potions started to take affect again, I shuffled my way though the darkness, there was a small light at the end of the darkness that lit up a small patch on the floor. I made it over to the light without issue, there didn't appear to be anything in here. I looked out and well it was not an exit. The hole was rectangle and cute smoothly. Beyond it was the view of a small bridge with fires burning around it, the bridge passed over a fissure in the ground which was deep enough for only darkness to be visible below it. The bridge however was broken, the gap between was as large as a small house and only the ends of each side of the bridge jutted out.</p>

<p>The sight was an odd one, I guess someone wanted to overlook who crossed the bridge but it was so high up even if I jumped out I would die from the fall. If I missed the land and fell into the fissure below I would need to take a break from my screaming before I hit the bottom.</p>

<p>The one thing I did not think I would need would be a light source but here I was sat in the dark. I took out pieces of flint wrapped in cloth from my back on my waist. Luckily I was not a fire-mage before this and would still need to create fire like everyone else. I am sure it might of been possible with lightning but I did not have that level of control. My inventory was 140 items before, room enough for countless pieces of junk but now I could only access 10 slots. Luckily I filled the health potions and other important things in first but that left the random warm clothes and things I could set fire to out of reach.</p>

<p>Soon the cloth caught fire and I held it up with the remains of my warhammer. Inside was a desk to one side, the size was far more human then immortal. The walls where coated with the wood and there where carvings of birds everywhere. Some even had a human body with bird wings coming from the back or under the arms. The door I came though was a darker wood, almost black in color.</p>

<p>There was another door in the room thankfully, this place must of been some kind of study or watch room for people passing over the bridge below? I took one last look out of the window. It seemed that was the path Tisiel and Reingard took as they where stood on the bridge now.</p>

<p>Reingard had walked up to the edge of the bridge and looked around Tisiel seemed to be watching from behind and talking to Vortigern. Just as I was about to shout, Tisiel turned and ran into Reingard with her arms out pushing him from behind as he fell into the fissure below.</p>

<p>Reingard's body, with all of his bags still on him fell into the darkness. I saw the skeleton from before move down towards Tisiel on the bridge. I was not sure if I wanted to shout out now, I was unable to save her and she had just killed Reingard.</p>

<p>At that moment she disappeared from my vision and reappeared on the other side of the bridge. It was then I noticed that on that side stood 3 skeletons. These where true skeletons, there was no shadow holing them up inside but they where the size of immortals. Was it possible Vortigern had tricked them? They did not attack Tisiel however but seemed to greet her, she walked in between them and they all turned and walked off together.</p>

<p>What could I do? I just stood staring at the scene playing before me like some kind of silent twisted nightmare. I couldn't understand at all Tisiel loved Reingard, did she push him thinking they had no chance to live and didn't want him to be taken? Did Vortigern trick them? Did she do it on purpose? How did she get over the bridge?</p>

<p>Ah! I jumped up and stormed for the door hoping my luck would change as the only way it could get worse was if I was stuck in here. I pushed in the same metal button as before and it slid inside and popped out as the door swung open after a few moments. Inside was a spiraled stair case leading up. Hopefully out.</p>

<p>The stair case lead me to another door made of the same color of wood with the same design. It was strong enough to keep those monsters out so I had no chance to break though it, really lucky the mechanisms still worked. I opened the door and it swung inwards as a man wearing a white and red monkey mask fell down at my feet.</p>

<p>He was wearing odd clothes, kind of cloth that folded over his chest in serval layers and baggy trousers. His shoes where made of plants woven into each other, in all he looked like a Leikan. "You alright?" I asked a little startled that there was even anyone here.</p>

<p>He looked up at me. Then quickly got to his feet. "Am I alright? Yeah. Why do you speak Alden? How did you get inside of the netherwood door? Are you a priest of the dead?" He said looked at my outfit and reaching for a sword by his waist.</p>

<p>"What? I am a student at Brandenburg Magic Academy! I just came out of a tomb I discovered by chance, there is no need to attack me. The outfit is just something I found down there, it is not my normal clothes but they got damage in an accident..." I trailed off at the end not wanting to say anymore about it.</p>

<p>"A student at... Otto? It's you!" He let his hand drop and put a smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I. How do you know me?" I asked more guarded now.</p>

<p>"Ah I saw you in Lakia town in the academy in the past. I even sat next to you once when you where eating there. My names Takeo. Quick get out of the netherwood, it is only used in places of strong death to hold back the creation of undead. The wood absorbs the death mana." He said while pulling on my arm to take me with him outside.</p>

<p>"Honestly I am just kind of glad to be out of the tomb. How do you know so much about the wood here? Is it common in Lakia?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is mostly used by the Pocotcotco people. They use the rule this whole continent and this wood was used where ever there was large amounts of undead. I was just here because I found a record of this place and wanted to explore during my time off. Did not expect to see anyone else out here." He replied as we moved into a jungle. The door was in the side of a cliff face surrounded by green and trees.</p>

<p>"I had no idea they used to rule the whole continent! But there is defiantly a boat load of undead down there!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Erm, maybe you have not yet started history classes perhaps? All students learn about this during education even in Alden." He replied as we walked back to a small camp he had made just 10m from the cliff face.</p>

<p>"Ah yeah, I think we start history classes next term, they are easing us into the changes in our lives." I said unsure myself.</p>

<p>"Mmm I guess it is a big change from the villages. I bet you will be too busy to go out like this any time soon then. Problem now is you are a first year alone outside of the academy, I sure know you did not come here alone. Where are your friends?" He asked his tone turning somber.</p>

<p>"As far as I know either dead or undead. I need to get back to the academy, but I am in to state to do so."</p>

<p>"You can come back with me, I have the party skill so I should be able to keep you alive." He replied.</p>

<p>"Don't you have work here to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not work, like I said I was just exploring during my time off. Plus the reward for taking you back safe is more then I will gain here." He said.</p>

<p>"Reward?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You think they won't reward me? With the information about a tomb you are bringing back instead of all of you being wiped out and the information being lost is worth a reward I think. It's early morning so unless you need to rest we can head off now the journey should take a few days." He said grabbing some of his things near by.</p>

<p>"I just want to get away from this tomb. What ever is down there I want nothing to do with it." I replied honestly. We set off soon after back for the academy.</p>

<h4>Home against</h4>

<p>The trip home took a few days, Takeo's party system allowed us to see each others health which was really useful. From what he told me though was because of the large level difference the low levels monsters gave him zero experience towards a level up so I would also receive zero experience. Along with that any high level monsters I was unable to do a high level of contribution in the fight so the experience again was heavily weighted towards him. I did share with me that some humans have high level party skills and that helps negate these problems, but most either only grab the first level or stop at the third because that's all they need.</p>

<p>We talked while we traveled about what I had found, I figured I would use this as practice for what I was going to tell the academy. I left out the parts of Tisiel and Reingard's ending as I was hoping the academy would be able to look for them.</p>

<p>I had lost my academy traveling robes and with it any indication I had with me. Once we arrived back at the academy's walls which ran in a semi-circle around the side of the academy facing into the wild and stopped at the large valley near the bridge we had to cross when I first came to the academy. If I could see though all the buildings or I was stood on that bridge looking back I would of been able to see the small fortified building which houses the portal.</p>

<p>The walls of the academy where old, and mostly for stopping students from leaving these days as nothing had attacked the academy that would require walls since it was first discovered. As part of the process for reentry I had to write a report on what happened since I had left and where my companions where. I told them a similar story to what I told Takeo.</p>

<p>After waiting around for two hours Lubin and two other teachers had come out to collect and interview me. It was the head of the first years students Arrilian Sirillin and Lenne Klein who was in charge of student welfare. Arrilian as his names suggests was not an Alden but from the kingdom, being a talented noble he was able to study in the academy and just never left. He was tall, lean and now old with a beard the length of a forearm and soft blue eyes decorated with the wrinkles of age. Some say he is over 100 years old but only 68 in appearance and records.</p>

<p>Lenne was short. I was not tall and only 14 years old, while I could look Lenne directly in the eyes without having to tilt my head while sitting down. Her eyes where a kind of deep blue that looked as if she was always on the verge or tears or a day dream. She dressed in a child like manner which only made her look like a living doll. Her hair was in pigtails or bunches I was never good with women's hair, but a ribbon was wrapped around each and her hair let free after each ribbon. She wore an old Alden style dress which you could find people wear occasionally or for traditional events but would now only be found on actual dolls you would give to a small girl.</p>

<!-- dress image -->

<p>After quick introductions and checks that I had suffered no physical damage that had not been taken care of yet Lenne insisted on doing a metal check before I told my story to which Arrilian looked annoyed as he just wanted to get on with getting information from me and Lubin was more respective to the idea.</p>

<p>I am not sure how professional this examination was as she asked me my name, age, date of birth, where I was born, parents names, teachers name and a few questions about the lightning element. Arrilian plastered a fake smile across his face, he did not seem like a bad man just one who was aware he had bad social skills. I recited the story I had written down from the moment we left, leaving out how we really met the third years and out initial intentions. All the way up to meeting Takeo outside of the netherwood exit.</p>

<!-- Put them both inside storage rings? or find a way to get past the scanning of inventory for the items? -->

<p>I had placed my new outfit in my inventory before arriving while traveling with Takeo saying they where cold, he had given me warmer clothes I was going to return to him later but he insisted I burn them. I guess being in a tomb with dead bodies has left me with an unpleasant oder. In short I had left out anything that happened in the armory, along with the incident with the coffin and any mention of Vortigern chalking the discovery of the tomb to the third years.</p>

<p>"An interesting story, the academy will have to explore the tomb of course, as if it is as you said crawling with undead a potential threat to the living and great opportunity for those of us who use the death element." Arrilian said. "Oh and one more thing, it might interest you to know that Linhart did not die after his fall from the bridge. He has in fact made it back to use claiming that he saw you die. A curious thing mind, it might be that there is illusion magic at play and not all of your friends have died." He places his hand on my shoulder, this was maybe meant to reassure me but felt like an accusation. It was hard to tell with Arrilian.</p>

<p>Our meeting was over after that and I was taken off with Lenne and Lubin into the academy. Lenne said she would arrange for me to move residences if I wished, after all the residences at the cliffs was a dwindling number and the place seemed to bring the occupants back luck. Despite it being nice to have a lot of room to myself, she was right that place would just hold old memories now. So I asked to be moved to the wooded Leikan area, which was met with a shocked face from Lenne, but she said if I insisted that was the place I wanted to be that would be fine but if I changed my mind I should come back anytime and tell her.</p>

<p>After Lenne parted ways with us Lubin asked "Why did you chose the Leikan area? She was offering you far better and closer residences to the academy. You didn't have to be so polite and pick some where near the cliffside if that was your intention. It wouldn't be a problem to move you close to the nobles quatres if you asked her." I caught the hint at the end, that even if I asked moving into the nobles quatres would be impossible and even moving near it would be a huge upgrade for me.</p>

<p>"Ah, I like the food." I relied simply, and being honest that is all I was thinking at the time. Lubin just laughed and put it down to me not haven eaten a good meal in a long time. Once we had reached the academy's market and shopping area Lubin headed back to the academy, he had to work after all. I headed into the Leikan area to get some food and then I would go to the cliffs to pack.</p>

<p>I headed to the same place I had the ramen before. I picked another stand, a kind of want to try all of the foods here while I could. Leikan food is not popular in Alden and hard to find. You would think it would be easier being that Leika is not far from Alden but their diet is so different.</p>

<p>I found a stand near by selling 'Oden' it just seemed to be a random assortment of foods in a warm broth. Honestly it was better then I thought it would be. I figured it would be like stew but the taste was more salty with soft boiled eggs, fish shaped as balls and an assortment of food I never even heard of before. He said the vegetable was 'Daikon', could of been anything for all I knew.</p>

<p>"Ah you have already eaten! Damn it I was too slow." I turned around to see Tsuma standing behind me.</p>

<p>"How did you know I was here? I just got back.. But it is great to see you!" I replied putting the chopsticks to one side not wanting her to see how badly I used them.</p>

<p>"Mmm news travels fast in this little area, and you stand out." She replied. I took a look around and sure enough I was the only Alden here but this place was part of Alden, kind of. Surely others must come by.</p>

<p>"So did you want to go get something?" I asked since she seemed upset that I had already eaten.</p>

<p>"Yeah, celebrate you came back okay, but you already ate." She said disappointed.</p>

<p>"It's okay I haven't eaten real meals in a long time before this, I can eat twice. What do you want?" I smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah really? Then take me to get Alden food." She said grabbing my arm and pulling me away.</p>

<p>"Ah I haven't paid yet." I said.</p>

<p>"Err, Ogori!" She shouted to the man behind the stall. He nodded back. "It's done now let's go."</p>

<p>"Then it's a date." I said.</p>

<p>"A date!?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, we are going out to eat together. It should be a date."</p>

<p>"Mmm then lets go see the shrine afterwards, okay?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" I replied and we headed off back in the direction of the academy. A shame she did not find me sooner but can't be helped.</p>

<p>I showed her around some Alden style restaurants selling sausages, pork on the bone and white bread. These places were expensive, but I was hoping to pay with some of the gems I grabbed in the treasure room. Since they had no mana the academy had no interest themselves. Somehow we ended up in a republic style restaurant eating a course meal. I guess this trip out would cost me all my gems.</p>

<p>The meal was really nice, nicer then any food I had in my life. Since Tisiel was gone I would be unable to safely sell the wood-death set I had stored away, maybe these gems where all I had to show from that trip. I tried to insist that I pay but before I could even take the gems out Tsuma had said she would pay since it was her treating me for coming back alive. I guess she can't be poor if she could afford to study in a foreign country.</p>

<h4>Shrine Date</h4>
<!-- Mask -->

<p>We walked from the restaurants back to the wooded area of the Leikan people and down a quiet path I had never thought to take before. At the bottom was a shrine, a small pond in front of it with a narrow stone crossing though the middle to the shrine. The shine itself was made of wood and looked rather unadorned. </p>

<div class="pop">Shrine<img class="popOut" src="./images/shrine.jpg" height="400px" alt="Shrine"></div>

<p>Once inside we stood side by side and she handed me a coin with a hole though the middle. We both tossed one each into a box in front of us, then we bowed twice and clapped out hands twice and finally bowed. I made a small wish while doing this unsure if we were suppose to wish for anything.</p>

<p>We walked back outside and resumed our conversation. "Oh the witches hat I gave you before, I found out the previous owner was the witch of Alden."</p>

<p>"Oh! That is amazing! Do you need it back then?"</p>
<p>"What no. It was a gift. Just thought you might be interested also. Speaking of, I have another gift."</p>
<p>"Eh? Already? You only just gave me the witches hat! It cannot be anything expensive."</p>
<p>"Relax, it is just something I found in the tomb. Since I left for so long it is only right I bring something back with me." She seemed to agree with that sentiment at least.</p>
<p>I handed over the set of death and wood attribute clothing. With Tisiel gone I would be unable to sell them or even bring them out without the academy sticking their noses in deeper. I was hoping Tisiel could at least make use of them back in Lakia, I don't know why I thought this but since they always lived in the woods I assumed they had a connection to the wood element.</p>
<!-- The items had to get past the checkpoints so how? -->
<p>"This. This is death priest clothing from the immortal world. How do you even. From the tomb you just left? Do you know what this is?" She said going higher pitched to the end.</p>
<p>"You know what it is? I found it in the tomb, I have another set of fire. The other 4 sets where lost when I lost my friends."</p>
<p>"Ah yes I suppose you would not know the stories of the immortals are treated as myths by... Mmm. How to say this? There are some people who know that the immortals use to be apart of this world but left. The places they went and built are always inside of portals. Their tombs left for their descendants are a source of wealth and technology or so they use to be until modern times. Their technology is not that far ahead in most places now and in fact behind in a lot of areas. What they considered to be treasures are sometimes not held very highly now. Anyway the point is towards the end of the immortals they split into three factions. Life, death and balance. Are you with me so far?"</p>
<p>"Yeah I am just kind of amazed you know about all this.. It took me and Tisiel a lot of research to find out even less then this."</p>
<p>"You are not the only ones digging up immortal tombs and doing research." She giggled. "Now the three factions all have powerful members who ran everything, ones personal power meant everything to them. These outfits where given to the strongest members of each of those factions. Fire, earth, water, metal and wood were holy elements to them and so the leaders each had a representative element, the last leader being the over all leader of the faction. These outfits where less their battle armor but more like ceremonial armor, but they where still the leaders of the top factions are the end of the world. While not at its peak the materials and craftsman they had access too..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay! So it is something real valuable?" I asked a little taken back by the flood of knowledge she had.</p>
<p>"Ah I was just getting to that part! You see the immortal tomb of life was found in a portal in Utnaulach, about 400 years ago. A town which Lakia is currently in control of. Inside they found a set like this for each of the elements and one final set, after a lot of fighting and exchange of money and land. Alden holds the metal set, Huonhia the water set, Leika the wood set, Hatalia the fire set, Chingaling the earth set, leaving the final set of pure life in Utnaulach at the academy there. What you have given me is too much, but I cannot say no... The sets are used to research the abilities on them, they are worth starting wars over."</p>
<!-- Fire, earth, water, metal and wood -->
<p>I could only stare blankly at what she had just told me. I am walking around with items countries would start wars over. I am level 1 right now, the least qualified person in the world to be holding these sets.</p>

<p>"If that is the case then can you send it to your people in Lakia? If I hold onto it maybe it would not be to my benefit in the end." I suggested.</p>
<p>"Of course I can but, it is taking a big research opportunity away from Alden." She replied.</p>
<p>"I already gifted to you. It's too late to give it back." I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You are far too trusting..."</p>
<p>"Maybe you can pay me back in information, you seem to know a lot of things I do not, and I did recently lose Tisiel my source of odd knowledge." I commented</p>
<p>"Ah, sorry maybe this was a bad time for a date, you just lost a friend." She held her head down low and replied softly.</p>

<p>I took out the mask I had gotten from Leon back when I last visited him, we had no clue about what it was or used for but I figured I'd give a shot asking since it looks like a Leikan design. I held it out in two hands and asked, "Do you know what this is? I don't. It was a gift from a friend.."</p>

<p>She looked back at the mask then laughed a little, "You must have an interesting friend to give you a gift like this, it is a shrine mask. We wear them during festivals and special days when we visit the shrines. There are two kinds, ceremonial and godly. Once you have a god you wish to follow, you take the mask to a shine and get it blessed by the god. If the shrine built for that god, the blessing would be better, but it is not necessary. The god will bless the mask, similar to religious jewelry here in Alden."</p>

<p>"Oh, then does this belong to someone already?"</p>

<p>"If it did, it does not now. There is no spirit mark on this mask." She held out a white and red mask, it had the face of a tiger but it was quite cute and would only cover the top half of a face. "This is my mask, if you let your mana feel the mask you can see that my mana is infused with the mask, this is a kind of mark to bind the mask to me."</p>

<p>I passed my mana over the mask and could feel the familiar mana of Tsuma coming from inside the mask. I had to ask. "Would I be able to bind with this mask?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you want? Once bound it would be very difficult to break that connection with the god."</p>

<p>"I can have a connection to more then one God right?"</p>

<p>She gently placed the tiger mask in her hand onto her face, no straps where needed it gently fit into place as if it was made to fit, "If other Alden's heard what you just said they would be very shocked.." She walked towards the shine and I followed mask in hand. "It is not possible to receive the faith spells from more then one God. However.. It is possible to make a connection to more then one God and wear and receive benefits from the items of other Gods.." With a small smile she lead me to the front of the shrine.</p>

<!-- Byakko, autumn, west metal, lightning (our book) -->
<!-- white stag,  -->
<p>"The stag mask you have represents one of the gods of lightning. The white stag is from one of the local religions, Chingaling I believe. They have a similar religion to us, Alden puts Chingaling, Huonhia and Leika's religions into the same category." Pointing to the white tiger mask she has on her face and says "This mask also represents a God of lightning, Byakko, he is the lord of season of autumn, the west and metal. What is import for us though is that both will be Gods of lightning! Although he will not be your faith God if you have a first connection already."</p>

<p>I could not help but let out a small laugh and smile, seeing that we would be bound in this small way gave me a feeling of butterflies in the pit of my stomach. To make a connection though the mask I had to produce a drop of my blood and place it inside of the mask where the mask would touch my face, place it on the alter inside the shrine and make an ernest attempt to connect to the white stag God. If all went well the god would bless the mask and it would become a magical item, then I could fill the mask with my mana and bind it to myself.</p>

<!-- god reply? -->

<!-- Hunt / lightning / direction / sun / two brothers (clone?) / white stag / messages / many different white stags different abilities, different gods -->

<!-- 
Hungarian
In Hungarian mythology, Hunor and Magor, the founders of the Magyar peoples, chased a white stag in a hunt. The stag lead them into unknown land that they named Scythia. Hunor and Magor populated Scythia with their descendants the Huns and the Magyars. To this day, an important emblem in Hungary is a many-antlered stag with its head turned back over its shoulder.[24]

<!-- Shinto 
Deer are considered messengers to the gods in Shinto, especially Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture where a white deer had arrived from Kashima Shrine as its divine messenger. It has become a symbol of the city of Nara. Deer in Itsukushima Shrine, located in Miyajima, Hiroshima, are also sacred as divine messengers. In various parts of Northeast Japan, a deer dance called "Shishi-odori" has been traditionally performed as an annual shinto ritual.[28] -->
<p>I picked up the mask and scanned it with my mana, I was told white stag mask would increase my magic by {0.4 x level} points or something equivalent, if I had a suitable lightning type power then the mask might be blessed with a lightning blessing. Either way the item would be a common item and the description name would be blue.</p>

<li>Head:<font color="blue"> Ceremonial White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

<p>When I scanned my mask what I saw was surprising, it must have something to do with the new class I acquired because the mask was not even close to the expected.</p>

<li>Head:<font color="purple"> Heavenly White Stag Mask.</font> Magic: +4.</li>

<p>"You said there were two types of masks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah the second type is not a kind of mask you will be able to get, it is a heavenly mask, this kind of mask there is only one of in the world and contains the will of that God. These masks are held in the main shrine in Otsu the capital city of Leika. Yours should show an increase in magic right?"</p>

<p>"Is that so... Well the magic defiantly increased."</p>

<p>"You have no home right? The lady you told me about said you would be coming to live near us, well why don't you come back to mine tonight? The place is really big because there is a princess staying there so there will be lots of room...." She suggested.</p>
<p>"I mean, I am suppose to go back to the cliffside and check where I have been assigned to, but I guess they will not have done the procedures yet. I will come back with you then if that is okay?" I replied.</p>
<p>"Sure lets go" She said back with a nod.</p>
<!-- Sleep with tsuma -->
<!-- Go home in the morning -->

<h4>The Morning</h4>
<p>I woke in a soft bed, my arm felt like the blood has been drained from it so I pulled it back towards me and along with it came Tsuma. Can't complain. So I just led in the bed awhile longer the sun slowly creeping up the bed.</p>

<p>A few hours later I was back in class. I had magic class with Lubin in the morning for one hour, a break and then lightning classes for one hour. After that we where suppose to be in our club activities until lunch. After lunch was our normal training. Today being the first day since my class had changed from Mage to Kʼawiil I found there where a few small problems.</p>

<p>For a start the magic classes where about the Mage class. The only parts of the lecture I could use where bits on the human race skills which was in the past the least relevant as I wanted to be a combat mage and not really the party leader. Also the lessons about mana and magic in a more general sense. I could only hope to get though any practical parts of the lessons by using the stress of just coming back as a reason why I could no longer cast manaball. Not sure how long I could keep this up for. Lubin ended the lesson by saying. "Next class we are looking at the stun skill, this is really useful for those of you looking to join the military, security forces, honestly since it is non-lethal it is a really useful skill. I would recommend you to get it but I will not force you I know some of you have your own family builds etc. See you next class."</p>

<p>I thought at first at least I had a lightning element class, so the lightning lessons would still be useful to me. That was true, the lessons where very helpful in understanding the lightning elemental and how to control it. It's just the color of my lightning had changed. Very visibly so. On top of that I had to use the same act from earlier this morning as a reason why I could no longer produce lightning spells I could use only before hand.</p>

<p>I was going to get caught out at some point.</p>

<p>I was suppose to go to a club until lunch time, I wrote down that I would join the martialist club. I assume I could get away with missing one week, or changing clubs. After all I had just been set back to level one, if I went like this it would be too obvious, even if I kept up my on physical body to its peak I would fall behind those with stat points in dexterity, strength and vitality.</p>

<p>I decided to head straight for the canteen, I would use my lunch token to get my lunch now and then take it over to the training areas. They keep monsters near the arena for testing students, there must be a way for me to register to fight some of them. I grabbed bead, a sausage and some cheese for my lunch, then headed to the arena area.</p>

<p>I wondered around the arena, once I got near area they kept monsters in a man stopped me at the door. "Students are suppose to be doing clubs now, I think you are lost. Only teachers can come inside here anyway, it's full of monsters." The man said. I quickly apologized and told him I must of gotten lost and walked away. There goes my master plan.</p>

<p>I walked pasted the strength testing area and decided to check out my ranking, there where some people gathered around it. They where from a body building club. I told them I was just walking past and wanted to check my ranking on the board quickly, they become more interested in me until while looking for my name on the rankings, I could not find it. I don't understand I was rank 4th for this years students, yes only the top 100 where on display unless you searched with your mana inside of the pillar but how could I of lost my place already? I scanned the pillar to find my new ranking, but it told me. "User is not found."</p>

<p>Was it because my class had changed also? My mana had changed? The body builders tried to console me, saying if I keep trying I can get back in to the top 100 again! I could only thank that they misunderstood my reaction.</p>

<p>Before I could leave they insisted on showing me how they train so that I could become stronger in the future. I was expecting them to be lifting weights like some of the military I had seen in the past. There was a boy on the ground doing an impersonation of an ape, hitting his fists into the floor, on his chest and then into a strength testing device. 20!? "What level is this guy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"15, it's a human perk. Ape Mode, increases strength damage with bare fists for a period of time, while decreasing your defences." A student replied. These people where mad. So I walked off while they were watching him.</p>

<p></p>

<!-- Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset because the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old world but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal.
