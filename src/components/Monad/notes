Using total war general speeches for the speeches 

"By the gods, how dare these peasants dare raise a hand in rebellion? How dare they? What were they thinking, if anything? Were they bored with buggering goats? Well, we'll kill them, and make the goats feel safer."

The enemy may have the Moon People on their side, but we have lovely hats! And those hats will protect us from their fearsome gaze! (If your general has the “mad” trait)

{/* Normal in the world to reach level 100, but few reset because the chances of unlocking anything new is little and it leaves you open to attack while you level back up. The advanced classes play a large role in the old world but in the new world people are leveling up less so getting to 100 is a big deal.
