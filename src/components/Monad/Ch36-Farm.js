      <h4>Farm!?</h4>
      {/* Found Otto's 'Farm' */}
      <p>
        I must be out of bounds, or the comity did not find this before the
        event started. It was a primate looking log cabin, it would be better to
        call it a tree trunk cabin since it was made of uncut tree trunks just
        piled on top of each other. Parts of it were riddle with rot and all
        things that crawl. While I was in need of a place to stay I was not just
        gonna rush straight in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved from tree to tree peeking out from behind. The cottage had tree
        stumps around it, must of been the trees used to make it. The
        surrounding area had various plants I had not seen before, and some I
        had. There were large vines with bulbous orange pustules pulsing out
        from them. Large red flowers, half the size of a person sitting on the
        floor between the riddle of vines. As for the plants I did know, there
        was corn in neat little squares past the strange plants. Odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to sneak past the plants but everything in my body was
        screaming that was a trap. I decided to keep edging around to see if I
        could see a way inside. Then I saw another student. Black robe with
        yellow trim, a lightning mage. They were standing within one of the corn
        fields looking at the plants, pulling them down, close to their face
        each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't worry. The plants wont harm you. If you tell me your name." The
        student said. His voice was deep, so I could tell he was a boy but since
        he wore his academy robe with the hood over his head I could not see his
        face. I did not miss the subtle hint he dropped, did he control the
        plants around here? He must be a lightning mage, students elements could
        not be miscategorised. Did he kill another student and wear their robe?
        Why? The robes helped the element you were.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he was really a plant and nature element then I had the elemental
        advantage. Without changing his routeing of looking at corn he spoke
        out. "You must be hungry. Tell me your name and I'll let you come in and
        feed you my corn. I don't want to trick or kill you. I want to end this
        silly game. All we have to do is all agree not to kill each other. They
        can't force us to kill each other." His voice was not soft, but it was
        not harsh, it just sounded almost hopeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You don't sound or look like someone who wants to sit things out
        quietly. You sound bored like someone who has tricked many people to
        their death." I accused him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ahaha. Do I really?" He turned his body to stop playing with his corn
        finally facing me properly. I reached up with both hands and I hide
        behind the tree trunk completely. When I peeked again he had pulled down
        his hood. He looked, average. His face was marked with acne, his hair
        was dark brown with muk, although I am sure mine was not clean either.
        His eyes were hazel, accompanied by naturally long eye lashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did he think I would trust him if he showed me his face? Pfft. "My names
        Otto." He shouted to me. He was so common, Aldenese name, look, accent.
        Not a single magic item on him anywhere. I guess he could keep them in
        his inventory but he should at least have his weapon hidden somewhere in
        these plants.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't give a rats what your name is." I spat back.</p>
      <p>"Corn tastes better then rat." He replied.</p>
      <p>
        What? I never said I ate them. Was he mocking me? "It's just your name.
        I'm not asking for your weakness." He continued.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Kaja." I told him. He was right, it's not like he could do anything
        with my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Really? Kaja the first year fire mage. Didn't you beat me on our 5th
        day here? The duels we did back in the arena." He said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've fought lots of people in the arena. I..." I guess he could of
        been. The name does ring a bell in mind now that he has said it. I was
        so excited back then I guess I forgot who I fought. "So what?" I
        shouted.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, we already know the outcome of our fight." He shrugged. "Some
        come eat some corn. With your fire we could cook it, that be a nice
        change from cold food." He replied while plucking two of the corn from
        the plant near him and walking back to the cabin.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he left I had time to slow down and think. Well he was a lightning
        mage, I've seen his element before personally. Not a plant mage, so no
        way he could control the plants. I stand a better chance fighting the
        plants then turning back. One opponent is easier then a group, it makes
        no sense not to follow him, even if I don't trust him right?
      </p>
      <p>Time passed. My belly rumbled.</p>
      <p>
        I walked out slowly between the vines, nothing happened so far, so I
        tip-toed across the vines staying clear of the large red flowers. Not
        long later I reached the field of corn Otto was stood earlier. I
        followed in his foot steps towards the cabin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Squatting down just outside the entrance he was facing away from me, the
        perfect time to strike. I lit up the fire in my hand. "I'm glad you
        came." He said without turning around which caught me off guard. "I'm
        not normally a vegan but I cannot eat this meat raw so I'm glad you came
        really." He turned back holding up a basket made of wicker? Inside was
        pieces of meat. Even now would be a good time to strike. Was he serious
        about his plan? Surely not.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's rude to kill a guest you invited to eat, but since you don't trust
        me we can sit facing each other if you like. I just want you to hear me
        out. But mostly I want your fire to cook." He said. It's been day and
        night can he really not go that long without eating?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Whats your game?" I asked. "You cannot sit this out, we have to kill
        each other."
      </p>
      <p>
        "That is what they said. If we don't kill each other, maybe they will
        even come for us themselves. I'd rather fight a losing fight against the
        ones who put us in this situation then play their game." He responded
        putting the meat on sticks over a pile of wood.
      </p>
      <Kaja>
        I still had the flame playing around in the palm of my hand. I threw it
        in his direction. Onto the pile of wood, the flames quickly ate up the dried branches.
