        I must be out of bounds, or the comity did not find this before the
        event started. It was a primate looking log cabin, it would be better to
        call it a tree trunk cabin since it was made of uncut tree trunks just
        piled on top of each other. Parts of it were riddle with rot and all
        things that crawl. While I was in need of a place to stay I was not just
        gonna rush straight in there.

        I moved from tree to tree peeking out from behind. The cottage had tree
        stumps around it, must of been the trees used to make it. The
        surrounding area had various plants I had not seen before, and some I
        had. There were large vines with bulbous orange pustules pulsing out
        from them. Large red flowers, half the size of a person sitting on the
        floor between the riddle of vines. As for the plants I did know, there
        was corn in neat little squares past the strange plants. Odd.
