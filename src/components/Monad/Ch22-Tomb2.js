          <p>
            As soon as I opened the door I saw Nymandus, standing in the middle
            of the room. He turned and looked directly at me. "I was just coming
            down to get you both. Linhart is not with you?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "He fell... How did you get here? And how did you know I would be
            here?" I asked in return.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hmm? The first door was marked with one line, once I cleared that
            floor I saw the real entrance. This whole set up looks like an after
            thought, an add on to the original. I came back to the stairs that
            lead down and came into this room. The outside is marked with two
            lines. while it was easier then the first room, I guess I still took
            to long to save Linhart. How did you make it up and not him? He was
            stronger then you." He asked looking at me puzzled.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You cleared a floor? The monsters here are ... strong." I said
            unsure if the floors he cleared were similar to the riddle ghost or
            like the monster on the first floor I came across. "The third floor
            was a riddle ghost, he got the riddle wrong. I'll wait here if you
            want to check it for yourself."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'll do that." He replied. "I think a powerful necromancer made
            these floors, the monsters all seem undead and old, maybe the
            necromancer is dead because they are weaker then they should be."
            With a flash a ball of white mana appeared in his hand. "I am a
            light mage, all things undead are weak to my magic." He looked down
            and squashed the light ball out of existence "Give me a moment to go
            see this ghost and if there is a way to get Linhart back. Wait
            here." With that he walked off down to the lower floor.
          </p>

          <p>
            In his absence I took a look around the room. A human skull on boney
            eight legs. There was nothing between the skull and the legs like
            the skull had the legs growing out of it. Serval of them lay around
            the room. As I turned I saw behind me the remains of a giant spider,
            it must of died a long time ago and was reanimated in this tower by
            the necromancer as Nymandus said. Now it lay unmoving in a pile to
            the right of the door I came in though, I wonder if it was already
            dead or if Nymandus really killed it himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the middle of the room coated in dust on a small stone pillar was
            a glass bottle, I blew on it and dust filled the air, rubbing the
            side gently I could see inside the glass bottle was a cloud, not
            just any cloud of gas but a cloud like you see in the sky, trapped
            inside a little bottle. As I rubbed more dust off I could see it was
            a little storm complete with sea water below also, this is
            interesting. I placed it inside my inventory for now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus soon came back, his face was unreadable. I felt like he had
            more experience then the others, they where all older then us but
            they acted no older at all as if their time at the academy had been
            shut in to dark rooms unaware of how quickly you can lose your life.
            Maybe sitting in dark rooms had sent them all mad.
          </p>

          <p>"So Linhart is gone. Did the ghost kill him? You said he fell."</p>

          <p>
            "He guessed the riddle wrong and although he was clearly pushed I
            didn't see what pushed him."
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus paused in thought for awhile before replying, "Well the
            ghost is banished now, it's a shame I did not make it in time. Any
            thoughts to what these extra trials are or why they where added on
            before the real entrance?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Not a clue, I had no idea until you told me but I guess each era
            will add their own protection measures on top of the old, maybe that
            is why this place became so hard to break into."
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus thought for a while before nodding and taking me into the
            first room. The inside was a mess, a large skeleton made of of the
            bones of many species with serval skulls, bone spikes protruded out
            of its back and its legs where made of many bones almost like round
            cages instead of a single bone anywhere. If it ever had flesh it had
            long since gone. While it lay on the ground the stone floor had burn
            and slash marks all around even the room was not untouched. If it
            where not for the mage light Nymandus was casting the room would be
            been pitch black, since he said he spent the longest here I have to
            assume he killed this creature.
          </p>

          <p>
            We pushed though the last door and entered a long corridor at the
            end was large pillars with a portal in the middle. Since it was
            still active we stepped though. Waiting on the other side was the
            rest of the groups, at opposite ends of the room. Of course the
            first question we got asked was where is Linhart. "He will be
            catching up later, he went back to the camp to get potions he had a
            hard battle." Nymandus told the group. Although I held my poker face
            on the outside I was relived inside that he said something like
            that, if Ditwin found out he died I could only imagine his reaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, since Linhart has gone back I guess we should wait here for
            him or head on back as well" Ditwin replied to Nymandus.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus thought for a moment before saying "I came to preform
            research on the undead, this place is a treasure trove of undead
            here, would be a shame to give up on even a day down here... Why
            don't you two stay just encase there are any treasures to be had.
            What with my concentration being on the ghosts and zombies who else
            could be left in charge of treasures."
          </p>

          <p>
            Ditwin agreed. "Can't leave treasures under the supervision of the
            younger students, they won't know what is good and what's not.
            Morons all of them. Can't be trusted."
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus just nodded. "Tisiel do you think this is the original
            entrance?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah... I am not sure what was here before, but the three separate
            areas we just traveled though seemed to be some kind of challenge at
            different levels. I am not sure it's purpose since they all lead to
            the same place. This seems to be an older structure I am not too
            sure if it's the original but it was defiantly here before the one
            we are in now."
          </p>

          <p>"We move forward then."</p>

          <p>"Wouldn't the entrance have protection on it?"</p>

          <p>
            Tisiel "Yes but it looks like either age or force have ruined it.
            Take a look these runes are broken and faded, even if the killing
            array or traps work since these are the detection runes none of them
            should activate. In Theory."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Since you say so, test out your theory." Ditwin sneered as he moved
            to block them from retreating away. Tisiel just responded by walking
            though the entrance way with confidence. After stepping though
            Tisiel added "Basic rune theory is taught as an optional class,
            maybe you should try it some time."
          </p>

          <p>
            We followed Tisiel's lead though the entrance way, along a bright
            marble white corridor lined with statues holding large weapons made
            of the same stone as themselves, they where not a similar style to
            the ones found in the pyramid but no doubt they had a similar
            function of protecting the inside from invaders. Luckily like the
            entrance way they seem to be inactive.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the far end where maybe a door should of been was just a large
            hole in the wall, it looked like it had been broken though and then
            tied up after but never replaced. Beyond that it became clear for
            the first time why this place had the reputation as a safe. With
            stone walls which must of been enchanted with magic and not made of
            any normal stone as although there where large blast marks and other
            evidence of battles taking place here not a single one was out of
            place and looked like they had not moved from the moment they had
            been placed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The walls spanned around the entrance in a semi-circle giving the
            intruders no place to go. After the first wall where more walls each
            progressively higher until the final layer which reached the roof of
            the cave. Turrets and platforms lined the walls breaking them apart
            into sections. There must of been more to it that we could not
            understand or magic we where unaware of but no doubt the academy
            would have a field day here.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just as I was spacing out & looking around at the breath taking
            sight Dipshit broke the silence. "Well that's just bloody great. How
            are we suppose to get inside!?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Though the gate Ditwin" Nymandus replied in an almost bored tone as
            if this outing had turned into taking a child though a museum they
            had no interest in. Sure enough in the direction Nymandus was
            pointing was a large gate house in the first wall, at around 8m tall
            with thick square towers flanking either side of a gate way. The
            metal gate was not lowered and so we walked though, zig zagging our
            way up though each of the walled sections.
          </p>

          <p>
            After passing though without so much as a scratch from the abandoned
            defenses the final wall with a tunnel like gate way which was 15m
            long in complete darkness opened into a room lit with dim fires
            around the perimeter. The moment Reingard step inside a slow clap
            came from the other end of the room. Clap. Clap. Clap. Followed by a
            voice like gritted sand " [Gibberish] "
          </p>

          {/*  "Ah young apprentices you overcame the trials I set ... Hmmm wait no, that's wrong. W-What year is it? You do not look like [Mayan's] at all." */}

          <p>We all turned to look at Tisiel.</p>

          <p>
            "I've never heard their spoken language before... I have no idea
            what he said. Let me just.." With that she pulled out a skull from a
            bag at her waist and held it up. The reaction of the others was pure
            confusion but they said nothing.
          </p>

          {/* skull = 5 civilizations including his own, then left in the study.

*/}

          <p>"[gibberish]" The skull said.</p>

          {/* Not seen a Mayan myself for.. Who knows how long it has been. */}

          <p>
            As the skull spoke to the voice from the other side of the room we
            slowly approached, since Tisiel started to walk forward as well, soon
            I could make out that there was a man sitting on a throne at the
            other end. The closer we got the more I could make out that this man
            had no eye balls, no skin. However he did have a few small muscles
            and ligaments along with his bones and clothes. While I am no expert
            and there is no way to tell right now how old this corpse is, it is
            truly remarkable that its condition is this good.
          </p>

          <p>
            "So that you all know, this gentleman here has been sitting here for
            longer then Alden has been a country, far longer. His was actually
            the last civilization before the one when I was sealed into that
            witches workshop. He is actually from the same people who built the
            pyramid although from a different faction, he worshiped a god of
            life while they worshiped a god of death. Ironic he became an undead
            I suppose..."
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus - "A god of life? What a great injustice he became an
            undead.. I would like to inquire about how such a thing would even
            happen. If he is willing I would be willing to purify him, if not
            well I will have to do it anyway."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah yes well I was getting to that, he does not know why it happened
            or how, it was actually one of the great mysteries of their
            end-times why so many undead came from this place but I think once
            we go deeper I will be able to help shed light on this. So please do
            send him on his way." With a simple nod Nymandus walked up to the
            undead man sat on the throne, their eyes or lack of in his case met
            and the undead mad nodded to him as Nymandus approached placed his
            hands on his head and gentle white light was released into his head.
            With that the man turned to dust.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Should we not of found out why he built that weird trial to get in
            here?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh right, to test apprentice from his tribe, he was trying to find
            one with the talent to make it past this room. Their church of life
            I guess you could call it did not control this tomb at any point and
            only later arrived after the majority collapse of their
            civilization, those who did had already sealed themselves within."
          </p>

          <p>"Fuck all that, what are you!?" Gelfrat piped up.</p>

          <p>
            "Oh right, first time meeting I suppose. I was once a man and now I
            am a skull I suppose."
          </p>

          <p>
            "But I can sense you are not the same kind of undead he was. I don't
            understand." - Nymandus
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah well I guess you would call me a sentient magic item, at least
            that is what I have come to learn so far but I have only been with
            you all for a short time.."
          </p>

          <p>
            The third years where all shocked. A sentient magic item. This is
            not something anyone could just have let alone so casually pull it
            out. Sentient items where so rare if the Grand duke of Alden even
            had a sentient item no one knew about it because he would never
            bring it out, let alone anyone of the other houses. The idea that
            this first year, and the weakest first year possible was walking
            around with a sentient item left their minds reeling.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first to move was Ditwin, as he strode forward Nymandus shouted
            "Stop!"
          </p>

          <p>
            "What do you mean stop!? That is worth millions!" Ditwin pointed to
            the skull in Tisiel's hands.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yes, and its sentient. Do you even know what that means? Even if
            you did take it from her, the moment you get back to the academy it
            could just tell the deans it was sentient, and you had stolen it.
            Don't let your greed blind you."
          </p>

          <p>"And so what? What if I just store it and don't let it out."</p>

          <p>
            "You cannot store sentient items. That's why she had it in her bag.
            You are a research student Ditwin you should know this much at
            least. Even if you did want it, what made you think you would be the
            one to come out on-top if we all started fighting right now? We
            haven't fought before Ditwin, but I know your second year ranking
            and I know mine."
          </p>

          <p>
            "If I can't have it I wont be silent about you having it either
            Nymandus."
          </p>

          <p>
            "None of us could keep something like this to ourselves, we will
            turn it in for other rewards back at the academy. Even after we get
            rid of it the rumors that Tisiel had this in her possession..." He
            turned to Tisiel "People will hunt you to find where you got it."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I know, but had I not just now, we would all be dead. He had just
            found out he was an undead, any longer and he would of gone mad and
            killed us all, you should know this better then us Nymandus."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah... We will just say we found it here. That might help a
            little.."
          </p>

          <p>
            With a sigh the skull continued "You all have a very basic
            understanding of sentient magic items but shall we first solve the
            biggest problem you have. With him gone the entrance you came though
            is naturally also gone, I am not sure what you will find if you go
            back but going forward won't be easy, have you not forgotten he
            spent many years here because he could not go forward. You know, to
            where all the treasure is."
          </p>

          <p>
            With the sudden reminder from the skull we had noticed that behind
            the throne was another tunnel, this one also dark but otherwise
            clean and clear. Gelfrat threw a rock down the tunnel. Thud. Thud.
            BANG. The rock was turned to dust from a large bolt of lighting out
            of one of the walls.
          </p>

          <p>"Otto you first" Gelfrat snickered to himself pointing at me.</p>

          <p>"How would that help?" I said back with a frown.</p>

          <p>"You're a lightning mage, it won't effect you."</p>

          <p>
            "That was heavenly lightning, pure white." Ditwin said with his
            mouth wide open.
          </p>

          <p>"You studied other elements?" Nymandus replied a bit shocked.</p>

          <p>
            "I study magical items, ranks, categories, uses and cost. Heavenly
            objects and how to recognize them is part of the course if only a
            short lecture as the chances of finding such high ranking items is
            impossible. Heavenly lightning would be a very clear indication."
            Ditwin

          <p>"So what?" Gelfrat</p>

          <p>
            "Heavenly lightning is not like normal lightning, he would never
            survive on his own." Ditwin
          </p>

          <p>"What else we suppose to do then?" Gelfrat </p>

          <p>
            "Ahem." The skull said, since really it could not cough. "Yes while
            walking into that death trap is one option, since the undead are
            getting out of here somehow in the past there might be another
            entrance. Nymandus & Tisiel would be our best chance if we take a
            look around to start."
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone started to look around at first, Gelfrat and Ditwin where
            the first to get bored and go back to throwing stones down the
            tunnel, in the hopes to find a path? Maybe I was giving them too
            much credit there. Tisiel took to reading the inscriptions around
            the room, some on pictures etched into the walls, others etched into
            the stone at the back of the throne. This is where Nymandus
            currently was looking down at the stone covered in writing. Reingard
            stood with Tisiel holding the skull as she wrote.

          <p>
            Tisiel seemed to be having the time of her life, the writing was
            from the skulls era or so he said. I had to ask so I went over and
            showed the skull the coins we had found, sure enough they where also
            from his era. The coins had depictions on one side and symbols on
            the other. Roughly translated coins had 'Death', 'Seal', & 'Time'.
            On the flip side the depictions, first the coin from the pyramid had
            an alter with a man ripping out a heart, this was also where I found
            the coin inside the pyramid on an alter, the people who had this
            coin last must of tried to recreate the image on the back. The coin
            from the king's tomb we dubbed the princesses coin had a stone cut
            into the shape of a person, I guess with the body buried inside like
            we saw back in the ruins. and finally the coin from the strange man
            I found in the forest. On the flip side it had the image of a pyre,
            a body being layed on a tower of wood and burned.

          <p>
            I sat down on the stone floor to think, if everything here is
            written in the skulls language, and the man from before is from the
            same era as the pyramid. One coin was witches study, then the king's
            tomb must also be from the witches era or later as that was where
            the key to open the study was found. Then there is 3 more eras
            between the skulls and the pyramids which he mentioned. Who knows
            how long he had been locked down there also...
