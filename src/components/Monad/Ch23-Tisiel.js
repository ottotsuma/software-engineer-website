          <h4>POV Tisiel</h4>

          <p>
            So the era of the pyramid, those people had found this place last
            and that means the kings tomb and the witches or any after had not
            found this place but had found those coins perhaps left behind by
            the race of people who built the pyramid. Thinking of this each of
            these groups should have historical names they match up to.
            "Vortigern, what where the names of the people from each of the
            eras? I can't believed I never asked..."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hmmm, well as you might know each era is home to many different
            races, tribes, people groups it would be hard to put one name on
            them so. I mean my people called them selves 'The Immortals' as the
            best translation but it is not like every sentient race called
            themselves so." The skull replied while remembering his old life.
            "Before us we called those people 'The Dao', so my best guess would
            be to say... Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, ****, ****, ****,
            Pyramid, Witch, Now. I guess after this expedition I will have to
            tell you all and others about what happened before, but right now I
            am also curious about this place as although it was built by my
            people, I know nothing about it. I am sure this was built by the
            people who worshiped a death god, and I was not one of theirs."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Every time I talk to you I feel a headache and more questions then
            answers.." Tisiel
          </p>

          <p>
            "Aha well for now, let's just keep working on a way out of here."
            Skull
          </p>

          <p>
            "Okay, I can do that much. Reingard why are you holding Vortigern
            like he will infect you? Hold him normally!" Tisiel
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard - "I mean, even if you are a magic item now Vortigern, I
            still feel like I am holding you severed head. No offence."
          </p>

          <p>
            Vortigern - "Ahaha, you are not the first to say so, it is fine,
            honestly this skull is really just the shape the material is not
            bone at all, to be honest the process was done on my whole body but
            as you can see it only worked on my head."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hey Tisiel, Skull, Reingard." Nymandus called out. "I obviously
            cannot read any of this script, but it is written in the ****
            script, it is not the same as the witting on the walls. Just a
            theory but it was added after to stop the undead from spilling out.
            I can see the light magic inside it and the death magic spilling out
            around it, although you cannot see it you should trust me it is as
            clear as day to me."
          </p>

          <p>"Moving it would require strength..." Reingard said "Otto...?"</p>

          <p>
            The others gave Otto a strange look, only Reingard and myself knew
            Otto's stat point distribution. While he was clearly not to happy
            that one of his trump cards was revealed, considering who Ditwin and
            Gelfrat are they would not take this into account when fighting
            later, our only real problem was this Nymandus who was far more
            knowledgeable then we wanted. Even so Otto walked over and pushed
            against the stone, it did not move at first but eventually it
            started to move to one side.
          </p>

          <p>
            After pushing it open, a smell of dead fish wafted up from below.
            While I am sure it was not fish I cannot think of any other way to
            describe what that smell was. Otto sitting on the floor a little
            tired said "I am not that strong, I mean compared to the undead I
            only have a few points in strength. Why could they not have broken
            out?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Nymandus - "The stone had light magic inside, if they touched it. It
            would of caused them to be pushed back. At least in theory. But
            since the stone is still here it must of worked."
          </p>

          <p>
            Skull - "Right well, everyone down I guess, expect. Otto would you
            mind staying up here? Only that none of us can move the stone and if
            anything should go wrong or an undead got past us. I think it is
            best if we seal the stone again behind us and when we come back you
            will know it is us."
          </p>

          <p>
            At this request even I had to look down at Vortigern, this was not
            part of any agreement we had before hand, and what did he mean if it
            went wrong. If it went wrong the undead being released would not be
            our biggest worry right then. "Vortigern..."
          </p>

          <p>
            Vortigern - "It's not just the release of one or two undead, in the
            past the amount of undead during the end of that era toppled far
            greater nations then Alden ever was. The academy may be strong, and
            while I have yet to see the extent of Alden, I have seen how strong
            each of you are. You are no where near the level students of your
            age where in the past. Otto, Tisiel and Reingard I can look past
            since they are younger but for third years to be in the 20's
            still... It is not bad, but it is not astonishing. What worries me
            more then that is that Tisiel has informed me that there is no level
            100 warriors in Alden."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Level 100!? What kind of monsters do you expect to find down
            there!? Even after all this time they should of become weaker..." -
            Nymandus blurted out of charter for his usual calm self.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vortigern - "These are undead who threw a far stronger nations into
            chaos. While controlled undead will lose their power along side
            their master and even crumble without enough mana to sustain them.
            True undead, undead born naturally will not decay with time, that is
            their true threat. They might not be strong, and have various
            weaknesses but they have time on their side."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto looked right at me, before slowly saying "I will wait up here.
            It must be getting later in the day so I will make a small camp
            here, I don't think we can return to Linhart in time because of the
            entrance collapsing so let's say if you are not back in 3 hours I'll
            assume something went wrong and go get help."
          </p>

          <p>
            Thinking of his words I couldn't disagree, there is no sun light
            down here so I am not exactly sure how far in the day it was. I
            guess since I got excited about all the new things to discover I
            lost track of time. Being unable to refute what Otto had said we all
            agreed, we would just take a small look around since Vortigern was
            so sure there would be high level undead.
          </p>

          <h4>Entering the real tomb, pov Reingard</h4>
          <p>
            It felt wrong leaving Otto behind while the rest of us went ahead
            with our plan. Although the original plan had been vague enough to
            account for all the unknowns in the tomb, this one was far more
            unusual and longer then our previous guesses. It was suppose to be
            simple, get in, get rid of them and return with the treasures for
            ourselves. Well, something like that. The planning was done by
            Tisiel and Otto, I was here for the crazy ride and the pretty girl.
            Thinking this I just smiled to myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Stop day dreaming. I am depending on you to protect me here."
            Tisiel looked at me with her big brown eyes and said "Without Otto
            to hit them while you pin them down I am worried about being able to
            protect ourselves a little."
          </p>

          <p>
            "You know I can at least block them from touching you, all you have
            to do is say so. That will give you enough time to get away, with
            your brain I am sure you can kill them in some of the traps in any
            tomb, especially this one." I gave her a small smile, she was too
            smart for me and would know that I was just trying to cheer her up.
            Honestly I was hoping we would of just called it quits and set up
            camp by now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the others had climbed down the hole, Otto closed the stone up
            behind us and told us to hurry back. Down here was just long dark
            tunnels. The walls where nothing special, just some kind of brown
            rock or at least that is how they looked with out mana-lights
            floating around us.
          </p>

          <p>
            The paths where weird, they twisted and turned in all random
            directions with some of them heading up or down at angles impossible
            for us to follow. It was almost as if some drunk creature had
            tunneled around forgetting where he was going each time. At the end
            of the path we had just followed was a dead end with a small pond in
            the middle, dim lights danced about as flowers and fauna or all
            colors and shapes grew around the pond. Honestly, it was really
            peaceful.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Small we rest here a little then head back to Otto? I mean we only
            came down for a quick look and with all the possible paths this
            looks like it will take ages to find what we want." I said to the
            group.
          </p>

          <p>
            "This place seems as good as any, I would of thought there would of
            been more undead down here, I can sense they where here once but in
            this place there is not anything left lingering..." Nymandus
            replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            I figured he must have some way to sense undead by his words. Since
            he said they had never even come here it must be undead free! I sat
            up against the wall, and Tisiel came and sat between my legs and led
            on me as I fed her bits of bread. We were free to act a little more
            normal now it was getting to the point the others where more of a
            liability then asset. Also I blerted out that 'There must be a
            treasure here repelling the undead! Maybe it's in the pond?' which
            kept Dipshit and Smelly-rat busy probing the pond.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few minutes passed in unusual bliss considering the situation we
            were in. Just as I got out some fruits to feed Tisiel, Ditwin had
            thrown another of his mana stones into the pond to see how deep it
            was, this time however a small winged creature started to flap its
            wings as it came out of the pond. It was almost human shaped with
            two small arts and tiny hands but four legs with no feet coming off
            its hips. It was a light grey and it's head was huge compared to its
            stick like body. With tiny black eyes and no eye lids it just
            hovered there for awhile before opening its mouth, inside it had
            human teeth, they looked like a human baby's teeth but still they
            where slightly too big for its large head. Although it's head was
            large that was only in comparison to its miniscule body. It was a
            little bizzar looking at this creature smiling at Ditwin.
          </p>

          <p>
            I felt a tug on my hand and Tisiel said softly under her breath.
            "That is a tooth fairy."
          </p>

          <p>"Not how I imagined them."</p>

          <p>"This is a tooth fairy pond."</p>

          <p>"It did come from the pond..."</p>

          <p>
            "We need to run. Fast." Tisiel said while jolting up standing still
            holding onto my hand tugging at me to come. I ran with her as fast
            as we could away from the pond area. I took one last look back and
            saw more grey creatures coming up out of the pond, then as we had
            gone too far too see back I heard Ditwin and Gelfrat scream bloody
            murder and then the sounds of them running also.
          </p>

          <p>
            In our haste we must of taken a wrong turning somewhere because I
            did not recognize coming this way, but Tisiel said we had to keep
            running anyway. Until the tooth fairy's gave up we had to escape for
            now.
          </p>

          <p>
            "My parents told me tooth fairy's don't attack humans, why are we
            running? What kind of tooth fairy is that?" I said between panting
            breaths
          </p>

          <p>
            "They are harmless most of the time, but when their home is attacked
            there is no creature who would not defend it. They do not attack us
            because they can get teeth from us they need and we are not their
            food, but Ditwin was throwing mana-rocks into their pond of course
            they would defend themselves. That is why I am saying if we can get
            away without them seeing us they will calm down and not attack us."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisle made sense as always, I do not know if her parents just read
            her strange stories as a child, taught her well or she was just
            smart. None of it really mattered. "You're really pretty when you
            explain things, like you are in your zone." I said without thinking
            about it too much.
          </p>

          <p>
            She looked at me and went a little red in the cheeks. I always liked
            her smart side, like there was nothing in the world she could not
            figure out given enough time. I went to try and say something else,
            but before I could Tisle planted a kiss on my lips. "Don't ruin the
            moment by talking" She said.
          </p>

          <p>
            All I could do was smile. We had run down so many twists and turns
            in these dark tunnels I was sure we would be unable to find our way
            back to Otto anytime today. In fact it was more likely that we would
            have to spend at least one night down here without him. That suited
            me just fine. Yeah it was dangerous down here but with Tisiel's
            smarts we would be fine and we finally get to spend a night without
            the others for once.
          </p>

          <p>"Hey sweetie, since we are alone..." I tried to say.</p>

          <p>"What? Did you forget I was here?" Vortigern said.</p>

          <p>
            "Ah you again, can't we just turn you to face the wall, it's not
            like you can move."
          </p>

          <p>
            "First of all, I can still HEAR and that is not how my sight works.
            Can you not see I have no eyeballs!? It's more a conscious awareness
            of my surroundings, so no you cannot just FACE ME TO THE WALL."
            Vortigern snapped back.
          </p>

          <p>
            At our exchange, Tisiel's face turned bright red. "So every time I
            put your in the draw back in the academy, you still knew what was
            happening outside?" Tisiel demanded.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Err.. Well the first time Reingard came over I thought you two were
            just going to talk like you and Otto. After that I felt too
            embarrassed to say anything... So you can see how this is not my
            fault.." Vortigern replied for the first time a little shy with his
            words. "It's not like we are even the same species anyway." He
            carried on digging his own grave.
          </p>

          <p>
            "YOU!" Tisiel shouted. "I should throw you down a random pit in this
            tomb!" She threated.
          </p>

          <p>"I approve." I added</p>

          <p>
            "Keep it down, tooth fairy's are not deaf you know." Vortigern
            muttered.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Alright, he's not wrong we should keep going a little, at least
            find a place we can rest, or hide." I turned to look at Tisiel to
            see if she was tired or could keep going. She nodded back and we
            headed off further into the tunnels. At first I thought we were
            walking randomly, but Tisiel soon shared that actually Vortigern had
            been telling her which direction to go, he said he had a theory and
            wanted to test it out. Since we had no better alternative she had
            been following his instructions.
          </p>

          {/* Switch view for awhile */}
          <h4>Back or never left?</h4>
          <p>
            It had been at least 2 hours since they left, maybe more. Without
            the sun and the sky I was unsure how much time had really passed. If
            I wanted to there where methods to find out, but if I found out it
            had only been 10 minutes I think I would really go mad. Not in an
            angry sort of way, more like ware my pants on my head sort.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was sat on the stone, back against the reverse of the throne. For
            awhile I looked down the lightning trapped tunnel ahead for awhile,
            thinking about ways to get around it, methods to trick it and lastly
            what would happen if i threw a chicken down there. Would it cook? Or
            just turn to ash straight away?
          </p>

          <p>
            After deliberating the important things in life I thought it might
            be about time to pray for the day.
          </p>

          <p>"It's not a new day, why are you praying already?"</p>

          <p>
            "I dunno what the time is down here, and let's face it there is no
            one and nothing to do on your end either why don't you tell me about
            how you ended up like this."
          </p>

          <p>
            "... I am not here only for your entertainment, if I had a large
            following I wouldn't be able to answer at all. Even with only you
            there is still other things to do, I have get things in place for
            the re-founding of my religion, inform my faction of my return and
            many other things here in The God Lands."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I didn't even know there was a God Lands, where it is, what you are
            even doing this whole time, I just imagined you sitting there alone
            in a dark void. What faction? You have friends!?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Sometimes I wonder if the Gods of fortune and destiny hate me.
            Forget about the God Lands there is no reason for a mortal to even
            know of their existence you can never even visit. Only those with a
            God level race can, and you are a human, a normal level race.
            Finally, your joke might be slightly right, they are not my friends
            but other Gods with the same area of worship, we only work together
            to avoid being defeated by the Gods with the opposite area of
            worship." The sentence ended with a bit of a sigh.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Think of it like this, I am one of the Gods of Death, there are
            many like me and we fight to be the ruler of Death. However as
            anyone could guess the Gods of Life are our opposites so we clash
            often. Our area of worship..."
          </p>

          <p>
            The explanation was cut short as the sound of foot steps echoed in
            the room. The foot steps where heavy and making no attempt to hide,
            with the dull rhythm it was clearly a person with two legs and not
            some multi legged creature. Since they where making no effort to
            mask themselves they where not aware I was here, or did not care.
          </p>

          <p>"This will be interesting"</p>

          <p>"Who is it?" I asked inside my head.</p>

          <p>
            "You'll see, I need to prepare something just encase, you are on
            your own for a bit." And with that he left the connection between us
            felt empty as if he let go of the rope between our minds.
          </p>

          <p>
            The sound of the steps stopped for a moment behind me, they resumed
            again shortly after and I saw the figure walk past me towards the
            tunnel ahead. If it was possible for my eyes to pop out of my head
            they would of. Linhart walked past me towards the tunnel. I wanted
            to warn him about the tunnel but my mind was too busy reeling from
            this information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Would it even work on him if he's dead? Do the undead get effected
            by the traps?
          </p>

          <p>
            Just then Linhart kicked one of the stones down the tunnel. The
            lightning went off and turned it to ash. "Good thing Ditwin is
            predictable, the ash marks on the floor shows the traps still work.
            Where you not going to warn me Otto?" He turned to look at me sat on
            the stone behind the throne.
          </p>

          <p>"I thought you died." Was all I could reply.</p>

          <p>
            "I did too, but no. Turns out that tower was a training ground for
            some mad man's apprentices. It just makes you start over again from
            the bottom." Linhart replied slowly. "I spent age fighting some kind
            of tentacle monster on the bottom floor before the tower just
            disappeared and now here I am."
          </p>

          <p>
            "The others went ahead, under this rock and made me wait behind to
            help them out once they come back from exploring shortly. The plan
            was to spend the night in here, but I think we should head back the
            entrance and get all of our supplies, I think we are running around
            without realising the day is long over and soon the exhaustion will
            catch up." I said while keeping ahold of the connection in my mind,
            waiting for him to come back.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Mmm, I had wondered if you would of come back, but none of you did
            so I brought the supplies with me. Just encase. I was bound to run
            into you all if i kept moving forward anyway. So we can just camp
            here, no need to go back." Linhart said while looking at the rock I
            sat on. "So the others are under that rock? Sometimes you say the
            dumbest lies. TELL ME THE TRUTH, ARE THE OTHERS THE ASH PILES IN THE
            TUNNEL?" He roared at the end.
          </p>

          <p>
            "No, you guessed right the first time, those are Ditwin's rocks. You
            know that." I did not move a muscle, I knew what he wanted. Revenge.
            Suddenly he pulled out a short staff, about the length of his
            forearm and hand. On top of the staff was a small fireball covering
            the end. He pointed it in my direction and said "You are not even
            level 20 yet, perhaps I should teach you the difference is not just
            stat points, some of my skills are level 2 and 3. You know your strength
            stat seems pretty high, I bet your charisma stats are rock bottom.
            Stand up."
          </p>

          <p>
            I was not sure what he meant by my charisma stat being rock bottom,
            why did that matter? I was going to do as he asked anyway while he
            had that thing pointed at me, but I felt more compelled to stand up,
            almost like my body wanted to before my mind. I soon found myself
            backed against the lightning tunnel.
          </p>

          <p>
            "They really under the rock?" Linhart was looking right into my
            eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            "There is a tunnel under the rock, it's not a normal rock. Nymandus
            said it contained the power of life and holds back the undead under
            it so that's why we had to close it back up behind them and I had to
            wait behind. No one else was strong enough." I told the truth,
            although my body felt weird, like I had to.
          </p>

          <p>"Walk down that tunnel" he motion with his chin.</p>

          <p>
            "I'd die." I replied. Glad my body was not fighting back on that
            one.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Seems like my charisma stat is not that high then. Walk down there
            or i'll blast you anyway. You're a lightning mage, so you should be
            fine." He smiled a half smile at his own words.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could charge him, but I would be blasted before I got there. At
            least I would die trying. I grabbed the connection in my mind and
            did the best I could to ask for any kind of help, I was going to
            die. Along with it his first disciple since coming back, and if I
            died down here, with the academy still looking over his old temple
            with only professors it would be unlikely he could make a come back
            anytime soon.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well? Do you want to burn?" Linhart was clearly on a short fuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            *Ting* The menu appeared in front of me. New Quest: Insult Linhart.
            Difficulty: Godly. Reward: Change Class #$!"%&.
          </p>

          <p>
            That quest... The difficulty seemed so wrong, but the reward was it
            broken or did he let a cat chose the name? Most importantly. What
            the hell is he doing!? How is this helpful!? I breathed out heavily.
            "I'm going just let me pray one last time you inbreed piss pot."
          </p>

          <p>
            "If you were not about to die, I would kill you for that." Linhart
            sneered.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did not care. Quest complete. Will you accept the class change to
            #$!"%&?
          </p>

          <p>
            Just then. "Accept it. The spelling is on purpose, if anyone knew I
            had this class I would be hunted down. Let along that I gave it to a
            mortal. We might have to go our separate ways for awhile after this
            until you are strong enough. I wanted to make you my champion in
            this era but looks like you will have to find me another. I trust
            you to tell no one. Just don't die here." With that the connection
            was gone. Not unattended. Gone.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was still the God I had listed but it seemed like he wanted to
            hide that as much as possible now. All I could do was accept.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I did Linhart had blasted me in the back with a fireball. I
            went flying into the tunnel as I accepted. *Ting* *Ting* *Ting*
            *Ting* *Ting* The sound kept going off in my head, all I could see
            was white lightning coming closer.
