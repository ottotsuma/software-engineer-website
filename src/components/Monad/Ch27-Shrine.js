            We walked from the restaurants back to the wooded area of the Leikan
            people and down a quiet path I had never thought to take before. At
            the bottom was a shrine, a small pond in front of it with a narrow
            stone crossing though the middle to the shrine. The shine itself was
            made of wood and looked rather unadorned.{" "}
          </p>

          <div class="pop">Shrine<img class="popOut" src="https://ottotsuma.github.io/images/shrine.jpg" height="400px" alt="Shrine" /></div>

          <p>
            Once inside we stood side by side and she handed me a coin with a
            hole though the middle. We both tossed one each into a box in front
            of us, then we bowed twice and clapped out hands twice and finally
            bowed. I made a small wish while doing this unsure if we were
            suppose to wish for anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            We walked back outside and resumed our conversation. "Oh the witches
            hat I gave you before, I found out the previous owner was the witch
            of Alden."
          </p>

          <p>"Oh! That is amazing! Do you need it back then?"</p>
          <p>
            "What no. It was a gift. Just thought you might be interested also.
            Speaking of, I have another gift."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Eh? Already? You only just gave me the witches hat! It cannot be
            anything expensive."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Relax, it is just something I found in the tomb. Since I left for
            so long it is only right I bring something back with me." She seemed
            to agree with that sentiment at least.
          </p>
          <p>
            I handed over the set of death and wood attribute clothing. With
            Tisiel gone I would be unable to sell them or even bring them out
            without the academy sticking their noses in deeper. I was hoping
            Tisiel could at least make use of them back in Lakia, I don't know
            why I thought this but since they always lived in the woods I
            assumed they had a connection to the wood element.
          </p>
          {/* The items had to get past the checkpoints so how? */}
          <p>
            "This. This is death priest clothing from the immortal world. How do
            you even. From the tomb you just left? Do you know what this is?"
            She said going higher pitched to the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You know what it is? I found it in the tomb, I have another set of
            fire. The other 4 sets where lost when I lost my friends."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah yes I suppose you would not know the stories of the immortals
            are treated as myths by... Mmm. How to say this? There are some
            people who know that the immortals use to be apart of this world but
            left. The places they went and built are always inside of portals.
            Their tombs left for their descendants are a source of wealth and
            technology or so they use to be until modern times. Their technology
            is not that far ahead in most places now and in fact behind in a lot
            of areas. What they considered to be treasures are sometimes not
            held very highly now. Anyway the point is towards the end of the
            immortals they split into three factions. Life, death and balance.
            Are you with me so far?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah I am just kind of amazed you know about all this.. It took me
            and Tisiel a lot of research to find out even less then this."
          </p>
          <p>
            "You are not the only ones digging up immortal tombs and doing
            research." She giggled. "Now the three factions all have powerful
            members who ran everything, ones personal power meant everything to
            them. These outfits where given to the strongest members of each of
            those factions. Fire, earth, water, metal and wood were holy
            elements to them and so the leaders each had a representative
            element, the last leader being the over all leader of the faction.
            These outfits where less their battle armor but more like ceremonial
            armor, but they where still the leaders of the top factions are the
            end of the world. While not at its peak the materials and craftsman
            they had access too..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Okay, okay! So it is something real valuable?" I asked a little
            taken back by the flood of knowledge she had.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah I was just getting to that part! You see the immortal tomb of
            life was found in a portal in Utnaulach, about 400 years ago. A town
            which Lakia is currently in control of. Inside they found a set like
            this for each of the elements and one final set, after a lot of
            fighting and exchange of money and land. Alden holds the metal set,
            Huonhia the water set, Leika the wood set, Hatalia the fire set,
            Chingaling the earth set, leaving the final set of pure life in
            Utnaulach at the academy there. What you have given me is too much,
            but I cannot say no... The sets are used to research the abilities
            on them, they are worth starting wars over."
          </p>
          {/* Fire, earth, water, metal and wood */}
          <p>
            I could only stare blankly at what she had just told me. I am
            walking around with items countries would start wars over. I am
            level 1 right now, the least qualified person in the world to be
            holding these sets.
          </p>

          <p>
            "If that is the case then can you send it to your people in Lakia?
            If I hold onto it maybe it would not be to my benefit in the end." I
            suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Of course I can but, it is taking a big research opportunity away
            from Alden." She replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I already gifted to you. It's too late to give it back." I said
            with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>"You are far too trusting..."</p>
          <p>
            "Maybe you can pay me back in information, you seem to know a lot of
            things I do not, and I did recently lose Tisiel my source of odd
            knowledge." I commented
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, sorry maybe this was a bad time for a date, you just lost a
            friend." She held her head down low and replied softly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I took out the mask I had gotten from Leon back when I last visited
            him, we had no clue about what it was or used for but I figured I'd
            give a shot asking since it looks like a Leikan design. I held it
            out in two hands and asked, "Do you know what this is? I don't. It
            was a gift from a friend.."
          </p>

          <p>
            She looked back at the mask then laughed a little, "You must have an
            interesting friend to give you a gift like this, it is a shrine
            mask. We wear them during festivals and special days when we visit
            the shrines. There are two kinds, ceremonial and godly. Once you
            have a god you wish to follow, you take the mask to a shine and get
            it blessed by the god. If the shrine built for that god, the
            blessing would be better, but it is not necessary. The god will
            bless the mask, similar to religious jewelry here in Alden."
          </p>

          <p>"Oh, then does this belong to someone already?"</p>

          <p>
            "If it did, it does not now. There is no spirit mark on this mask."
            She held out a white and red mask, it had the face of a tiger but it
            was quite cute and would only cover the top half of a face. "This is
            my mask, if you let your mana feel the mask you can see that my mana
            is infused with the mask, this is a kind of mark to bind the mask to
            me."
          </p>

          <p>
            I passed my mana over the mask and could feel the familiar mana of
            Tsuma coming from inside the mask. I had to ask. "Would I be able to
            bind with this mask?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Is that what you want? Once bound it would be very difficult to
            break that connection with the god."
          </p>

          <p>"I can have a connection to more then one God right?"</p>

          <p>
            She gently placed the tiger mask in her hand onto her face, no
            straps where needed it gently fit into place as if it was made to
            fit, "If other Alden's heard what you just said they would be very
            shocked.." She walked towards the shine and I followed mask in hand.
            "It is not possible to receive the faith spells from more then one
            God. However.. It is possible to make a connection to more then one
            God and wear and receive benefits from the items of other Gods.."
            With a small smile she lead me to the front of the shrine.
          </p>

          {/* Byakko, autumn, west metal, lightning (our book) */}
          {/* white stag,  */}
          <p>
            "The stag mask you have represents one of the gods of lightning. The
            white stag is from one of the local religions, Chingaling I believe.
            They have a similar religion to us, Alden puts Chingaling, Huonhia
            and Leika's religions into the same category." Pointing to the white
            tiger mask she has on her face and says "This mask also represents a
            God of lightning, Byakko, he is the lord of season of autumn, the
            west and metal. What is import for us though is that both will be
            Gods of lightning! Although he will not be your faith God if you
            have a first connection already."
          </p>

          <p>
            I could not help but let out a small laugh and smile, seeing that we
            would be bound in this small way gave me a feeling of butterflies in
            the pit of my stomach. To make a connection though the mask I had to
            produce a drop of my blood and place it inside of the mask where the
            mask would touch my face, place it on the alter inside the shrine
            and make an ernest attempt to connect to the white stag God. If all
            went well the god would bless the mask and it would become a magical
            item, then I could fill the mask with my mana and bind it to myself.
          </p>

In Hungarian mythology, Hunor and Magor, the founders of the Magyar peoples, chased a white stag in a hunt. The stag lead them into unknown land that they named Scythia.

          {/* Something wrong here */}
          <p>I picked up the mask and scanned it with my mana, I was told white stag mask would increase my magic or something equivalent, if I had a suitable lightning type power then the mask might be blessed with a lightning blessing. Either way the item would be a common item and the description name would be blue.</p>

          <p>
            When I scanned my mask what I saw was surprising, it must have
            something to do with the new class I acquired because the mask was
            not even close to the expected.

          <p>
            "Oh, yeah the second type is not a kind of mask you will be able to
            get, it is a heavenly mask, this kind of mask there is only one of
            in the world and contains the will of that God. These masks are held
            in the main shrine in Otsu the capital city of Leika. Yours should
            show an increase in magic right?"
          </p>

          <p>"Is that so... Well the magic defiantly increased."</p>

          <p>
            "You have no home right? The lady you told me about said you would
            be coming to live near us, well why don't you come back to mine
            tonight? The place is really big because there is a princess staying
            there so there will be lots of room...." She suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I mean, I am suppose to go back to the cliffside and check where I
            have been assigned to, but I guess they will not have done the
            procedures yet. I will come back with you then if that is okay?" I
            replied.
          </p>
          <p>"Sure lets go" She said back with a nod.</p>
          {/* Sleep with tsuma */}
          {/* Go home in the morning */}

          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            I woke in a soft bed, my arm felt like the blood has been drained
            from it so I pulled it back towards me and along with it came Tsuma.
            Can't complain. So I just led in the bed awhile longer the sun
            slowly creeping up the bed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few hours later I was back in class. I had magic class with Lubin
            in the morning for one hour, a break and then lightning classes for
            one hour. After that we where suppose to be in our club activities
            until lunch. After lunch was our normal training. Today being the
            first day since my class had changed from Mage to Kʼawiil I found
            there where a few small problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a start the magic classes where about the Mage class. The only
            parts of the lecture I could use where bits on the human race skills
            which was in the past the least relevant as I wanted to be a combat
            mage and not really the party leader. Also the lessons about mana
            and magic in a more general sense. I could only hope to get though
            any practical parts of the lessons by using the stress of just
            coming back as a reason why I could no longer cast manaball. Not
            sure how long I could keep this up for. Lubin ended the lesson by
            saying. "Next class we are looking at the stun skill, this is really
            useful for those of you looking to join the military, security
            forces, honestly since it is non-lethal it is a really useful skill.
            I would recommend you to get it but I will not force you I know some
            of you have your own family builds etc. See you next class."
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought at first at least I had a lightning element class, so the
            lightning lessons would still be useful to me. That was true, the
            lessons where very helpful in understanding the lightning elemental
            and how to control it. It's just the color of my lightning had
            changed. Very visibly so. On top of that I had to use the same act
            from earlier this morning as a reason why I could no longer produce
            lightning spells I could use only before hand.
          </p>

          <p>I was going to get caught out at some point.</p>

          <p>
            I was suppose to go to a club until lunch time, I wrote down that I
            would join the martialist club. I assume I could get away with
            missing one week, or changing clubs. After all I had just been set
            back to level one, if I went like this it would be too obvious, even
            if I kept up my on physical body to its peak I would fall behind
            those with stat points in dexterity, strength and vitality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to head straight for the canteen, I would use my lunch
            token to get my lunch now and then take it over to the training
            areas. They keep monsters near the arena for testing students, there
            must be a way for me to register to fight some of them. I grabbed
            bead, a sausage and some cheese for my lunch, then headed to the
            arena area.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wondered around the arena, once I got near area they kept monsters
            in a man stopped me at the door. "Students are suppose to be doing
            clubs now, I think you are lost. Only teachers can come inside here
            anyway, it's full of monsters." The man said. I quickly apologized
            and told him I must of gotten lost and walked away. There goes my
            master plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walked pasted the strength testing area and decided to check out
            my ranking, there where some people gathered around it. They where
            from a body building club. I told them I was just walking past and
            wanted to check my ranking on the board quickly, they become more
            interested in me until while looking for my name on the rankings, I
            could not find it. I don't understand I was rank 4th for this years
            students, yes only the top 100 where on display unless you searched
            with your mana inside of the pillar but how could I of lost my place
            already? I scanned the pillar to find my new ranking, but it told
            me. "User is not found."
          </p>

          <p>
            Was it because my class had changed also? My mana had changed? The
            body builders tried to console me, saying if I keep trying I can get
            back in to the top 100 again! I could only thank that they
            misunderstood my reaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I could leave they insisted on showing me how they train so
            that I could become stronger in the future. I was expecting them to
            be lifting weights like some of the military I had seen in the past.
            There was a boy on the ground doing an impersonation of an ape,
            hitting his fists into the floor, on his chest and then into a
            strength testing device. 20!? "What level is this guy?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "15, it's a human perk. Ape Mode, increases strength damage with
            bare fists for a period of time, while decreasing your defences." A
            student replied. These people where mad. So I walked off while they
