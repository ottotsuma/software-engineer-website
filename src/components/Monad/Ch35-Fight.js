      <h4>Fight!</h4>
      <p>
        The days had flown by since I was released from holding. Chu-gong was
        still down there when I left. We did not arrange to meet up after he
        left, I already had one guy act nice to me when I needed a friend, only
        to throw it in my face in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hands slipped across my robe as I rubbed the sweat from them. I
        thought I knew everything that was going to happen before the battle
        started. Maybe I missed something in that meeting I was removed from,
        but now stood here in a small cage made of earth, the overwhelming
        feeling was that I was not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around were many other similar cages, holding other students inside. The
        earth element was one of the most common elements, especially in Alden.
        So many of the students, staff and mage-soldiers had this element. There
        were extensive records, though trial and error on what spells worked
        well and what did not. Making these individual sized cages would barely
        be an inconvenience to these train mages.
      </p>
      <p>
        While waiting one of the kinder teachers stood up on a make-shift podium
        held up by the earth elements rocks. Lubin, a teacher I only knew of who
        my own teachers spoke of as someone who taught them how to teach. He
        climbed up and stood atop the rocks, an earth mage would just cast it
        under themselves so he must not be an earth mage himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Everyone. Now we are out of the ears of the audience, I will explain
        some things that previously I would of been unable to tell you. To
        start, the reason for the emphasis on the possibility of dieing. This is
        not the inside of the arena, or one of the training areas. The magic
        that usually teleports a student out in the event of low HP is not
        installed as robustly as in the arena. For the shaper ones among you,
        yes, that means it is installed but there is a much, much, higher risk
        of you not being saved."
      </p>
      {/* Gu poison */}
      {/*10,000 students per year. 36 students in a class, 278 classes? Well that is for the combat roles but not all students are combat. */}
      <p>
        "The final thing I want to tell you is why. The real reason why. Every
        year around this time we normally hold duels. The result of these duels
        going towards your final grade. The academy lets the military see these
        results every year. The records show that almost all students at the
        bottom by this point in the year do not preform well later on. Dieing
        early or becoming a burden is the usual outcome for students at the
        bottom who join the military."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now you might say that's fine not all students want to join the
        military, maybe you don't want to join. I am sorry to break to this to
        you now but there is to be a policy change in Alden. All students will
        join the military after graduation. In the future all students at the
        academy will be considered as part of the military also."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So back to the main reason. Do you know what Gu Poison is? Well the
        idea is something like sealing several venomous creatures inside a
        closed container, where they devoured one another, the final creature
        being the most venomous. If you need motivation to be the most venomous
        here. The chances of you dieing is high. Very high. The winner however
        will be rewarded far beyond what their classmates will receive. Good
        luck to you all."
      </p>
      {/* Showing of the arena and the contestants inside the jungle or walking to the area? */}
      <p>
        Lubin had left my sight and I couldn't help but ponder on what he said.
        They had set up a similar mechanism to save the students if their HP got
        to low but it was barely functional? I had been in the arena most more
        then most first years and everyone in the dueling club knew the
        mechanisms of the arena were found in the state they are today, not made
        by anyone from Alden. Where they using us as test subjects?
      </p>
      <p>
        My disgust at the academy would have to wait though, as the earth cages
        crumbled each of us. The area we were fighting in was the jungles to the
        east of the academy. They were usually thick with trees but a clearing
        had been made to house us for the start of the event. More then 270
        students were chosen as class champions, making the start a hectic wash
        of of colorful spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the students were a little slow or stunned like me at first. I
        had thought there was going to be a count down or something! I wrapped
        myself in a fire cyclone, a spell that would damage anyone who got too
        close to me. The first thing I was doing was running into the trees as
        fast as I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ground was moving and shifting under the wishes of the earth mages,
        the wind shot one way and then the other under the control of the wind
        mages. I kept putting one foot in front of the other, pushing though the
        freezing and burning changes I felt on my skin. I was almost at the edge
        of the jungle when a dull pain stuck the side of my skull, it rang
        around my head, bouncing inside as I fell to the floor. I braced myself
        with my hands but my head was so dizzy it hurt my wrist when I landed.
        On the floor next to where I fell was a rock held together by earth
        mana, it quickly fell back into dirt, the mage that cast it must be off
        knocked out, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt a warm liquid flow from my head and 'pa-ta' on to the ground. My
        vision was a little blurry but it was blood. I looked up and could see
        the trees so close to me so I pushed all my effort into my legs placing
        on in front of the other and ran into the tree line and deep into the
        jungle. I told myself over and over, 'don't stop'.

        "Did you see that!? That blonde girl almost died without doing anything.
        She just ran from the start." - Student A

      {/* Kaja was a little shorter then me, dark blonde hair and dark blue eyes */}
      <p>
        "Nah, I ain't gonna spend my time watching losers. Check out the middle
        of the field, it's like a king of the hill. So many people died. The
        first person was teleported out but I haven't see another get so lucky."
        - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Damn there is a pile of them there. Do you think they all died already?
        Surely they are just knocked out." - Student A
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't think they are knocked out. Look that body just got set on fire
        and didn't twitch at all. They're dead." - Student B

      <p>"Feels kind weird. It was so fast it doesn't feel real you know?"</p>

      {/* The start of the event with people running away, retards running for the middle to battle out the 'strongest' */}
      <p>
        "Sir, why were we asked to vote on class representatives? Wouldn't it be
        better to use our test scores?" - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huh? It's because the students know each other better then the teachers
        can. There are so many of you it was more efficient to let the students
        single out their weakest members. Yes, some stronger members might of
        volunteered for the role, but these kind of psychopaths who jump at the
        chance to murder are hardly suitable candidates to be your team mates.
        Just relax and sit back in the knowledge if it is their fate to die they
        did not drag you down with them." - Teacher
      </p>
      <p>"Wait, wait. Look over there, isn't that Garin?"</p> - Student A
      <p>
        "Oh shit yeah! I saw him on the lists, he's one of the favorites to
        win." - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Lists? What are you boys talking about? Are the students placing bets
        on this?" - Teacher
      </p>
      <p>
        "Err, yeah. It's on the academy board. I thought the teachers knew about
        it since it's on the public board." - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Honestly, it's all kind of alien to us. But I want in, help me place a
        bet." The teacher replied.
      </p>
      <div className="BreakPoint" />
      {/* Going for a 3rd party viewer, history style because of the people watching the game. */}
      <p>
        Garin had gathered a small group around him. Fighting alone, even the
        strongest would lose a fight to a group of people. Forming alliances are
        an important aspect of survival, by helping each other stay alive they
        eliminate small groups of competitors around them giving them better
        odd's at winning.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Garin was considered the strongest mage in the group, the other
        members were no burdens. Once the list of odd's was posted and bets
        started to be made, this group started to form of students likely to
        win. Their goal was simple, eliminate those with lower odd's, there by
        increasing their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group was made of 9, it was too large not to splinter. Non of the
        participants were of noble birth, however that did not make them weak.
        Garin and Jarvia were actually the top in the class and were voted in so
        their class would win.
      </p>
      <p>
        The starting battle had been a hectic brawl, the students had gone
        though a fight of flight from the start. Water magic had clashed with
        fire making the air in this clearing humid. The earth magic had reshaped
        the land below their feet into an uneven mess with pillars and large
        rocks littering the landscape. There were no blood mages present, still
        the rocks were stained a burnt maroon, the water still mixed with the
        crimson liquid in places.
      </p>
      <p>
        What had started as a small group of nine in a sea of students and
        spells, was now whittled down to four. It was hard to say how many had
        been saved and removed from the arena by professor Farald's creation.
        The four of their like laying at their feet could tempt them to say it
        was one-in-five. The litany of corpses decorating the field like a
        morbid pumpkin patch seemed to scream in disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many had run into the woods? How many had died running there? How
        many had stayed to fight? No one knew right now. It was safe to say more
        then half of those who had entered were morbid decorations now.
      </p>
      <p>Jarvia was the first to speak.</p>
      <Jarvia>
        "The rest ran into the woods. We should hunt down as many as we can
        before they form groups."
      </Jarvia>
      <Milo>
        "Shouldn't we rest? I mean look..." Milo replied trailing off into a
        blank stare across the field.
      </Milo>
      <Garin>
        "The longer we rest, the more they rest. Do you want to be a burn to the
        group?" Garin added.
      </Garin>
      <p>"It was just a suggestion." Milo replied.</p>
      <Garin>
        "Don't worry so much. Although that fight was hard, now they are alone.
        The one's who ran at the start were cowards. Now we can hunt them down
        leisurely and have some fun." Garin laughed.
      </Garin>
      <Jarvia>
        "I want to say don't underestimate a foe but even I agree those who did
        not fight here are just cowards. It will be easy for us to clean up."
        Jarvia smirked.
      </Jarvia>
      <p>
        Garin checked his status. 30% HP and almost depleted all my mana. I'll
        make Milo take care of the weak ones while I recover. I can't let Jarvia
        know I'm weak right now.
      </p>
      <Garin>
        The moment we left the center the air air felt fresher, less humid. I
        felt dizzy suddenly. Hot bile bubbled up from my core, coating my
        tongue. I couldn't hold it in and vomited onto the floor. Jarvia stared
        at me, so I spoke between breaths. "The jungle really smells." She
        didn't reply first, Bruna did who had been quiet up until now. She also
        spewed hot sick onto a fern.
      </Garin>
      <p>
        "Mmm" Milo hummed. He was pale but that was it. I spat on the ground and
        walked forward my head up high. The jungle was free and wild, the canopy
        of trees blocked out most of the sunlight, however it was not dark.
        Small plants brushed up against our ankles. Our robes kept all other
        wandering feelers of the jungle from our skin, aside from the bugs.
      </p>
      <Garin>
        The small flying bugs would find their way to biting and stinging us no
        matter the location. Bruna wasted mana batting them away from her until
        she was reprimanded by Jarvia. I could see how it was, the girls were
        going to stick together in the end. Maybe I shouldn't tire Milo out too
        much.
      </Garin>
      <Garin>
        The first person we found who had run from the start had become
        nourishment for a swarm of green flying beetles. They were each the side
        of an adults hand and crawled across his body ripping off chunks of
        flesh and bone in their pincers. The sound squished like stepping in on
        wet moss before an abrupt loud crunching sound.
      </Garin>
      <p>
        The teachers had told us they would clear up the worst and largest of
        the monsters but would and could not keep all of them out. We were lucky
        they were feeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Elsa?" Bruna said looking over. All I saw was monsters and chunks of
        flesh. "It's Elsa, she was in my sculpting class. She use to make the
        most beautiful mini ice castles with her magic." Bruna told to the bugs?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I guess she was one of the unlucky ones." I said, not really sure
        what to say, and immediately realized I should of said nothing when
        Bruna burst into tears. It was the kind of sobbing that wrenched at your
        heart strings. "Come on Bruna, you knew how this would end of most of
        the people in this." I said to try and shake her into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's different when it's someone you know." Bruna chocked back though
        sobs. She lifted the muddy earth from around her feet and bombarded the
        bugs around Elsa with a brown hail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The swam, aggrieved with Bruna, started a buzz of screaking and
        clattering. Do I help her or abandon her here? That was really dumb.
        Without the group I can't be sure to win alone. I was not the only one
        hesitating because the bugs had already made it to Bruna and she was in
        the middle of raising a wall of dirt when we all finally moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first to jump into action after Bruna was Jarvia, she brought up a
        tree root from the moved earth and crudely transformed it into a wood
        spear. Grabbing it in both of her hands, she trust it into the air,
        though the body of a beetle trying to fly around the wall of dirt. I
        conjured and morphed a metal sheet pushing back several beetles trying
        to move around the other side. "Milo!"I shouted as he moved in and
        unloaded a wave of flames across the beetles.
      </p>
      <p>
        They screeched and screamed, flailing their many limbs into each other
        and thin metal sheet I bore down on them. When Milo had let up he looked
        haggard, now was not the time to take advantage of him but the beetles.
        They had fled in all directions unable to pass though my barrier. Jarvia
        had moved a few paces back, the manic beetles too overwhelming, caused
        her to fall back and bring up more tree roots from the ground to guard
        her sides. There was a handful of burning remains in front of her
        defiant stance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I could move to take advantage of the opportunity Milo had
        created I also had to move back a few paces. Bruna had lost control of
        her dirt wall when a beetle or two had pushed though and pierced her leg
        with their mandibles. She wailed and screamed like a distraught
        banshee,barely formed rocks made of dirt flew out haphazardly into the
        fleeing and advancing foes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How long do you need?"I asked to Milo behind me. I formed the metal
        sheet into a pole, it was a little deformed but that just added to it's
        charter. When a beetle came close, I would break it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We should save Bruna."Milo replied. He ran forward and then darted
        behind me again when a burnt beetle had come to take it's revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "She brought this on herself, how long do you need before you can do
        that again?"I demanded to know. I smashed one of the beetles wings with
        my pole making it hobble and fall from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        "They won't form up again like that twice, I'll just use fireballs to
        take them out individually."Milo replied back,getting back into action
        shooting a fireball at the downed beetle. There was a screeching until
        it turned on it's back,wriggled and went silent,the sound of cackling
        fire consuming it's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jarvia! Milo cannot do that again, let's grab Bruna together. "I
        shouted across to her. She hesitated for a moment before nodding. She
        sprinted a moment after I did, I formed the metal back into a sheet and
        pushed at the beetles around Bruna,leaving the two onto of her to
        Jarvia. I grabbed the back of her collar and pulled her along the ground
        keeping the metal sheet across my left and half of her front. Jarvia
        keep the right side with her spear while we retreated back to the small
        nest of roots Jarvia had made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Milo, to his credit had not gotten himself killed or in the way, keeping
        a small distance behind me covering my far left. We stood our ground in
        that little nest, Jarvia focusing on the sides while I covered the us
        all. Milo took pot shots trying to snipe down beetles to make it easier
        to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had killed around half when they stopped coming at us. Most had gone
        back to their meal having lost interest in fighting for a new one. I
        grabbed the back of Bruna's collar in that opening and we all retreated.
      </p>
      <p>=====</p>
      <p>"It really hurts."Bruna kept repeating. </p>
      <p>
        "I should of left you to die. What a waste of mana, time, everything!"I
        shouted at her crying on the floor. She just sobbed. Her legs had not
        stopped bleeding, the bites were too deep. She looked pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to stab her with a stick. I grabbed Milo and looked to make an
        exit. "She's done for. She will just be a burden to us now."I spat out.
        "I am not going to become and easy target because of her mistake."I
        continued.
      </p>
      <p>
        Milo did not disagree, he just looked over at her then looked away. He
        knew it also. Jarvia was not a fool. Just because Bruna was a girl, did
        not mean she was going to risk her self for that moron. It's not like
        Bruna was even her friend before this. Her real accomplice had become
        the jungles food back in the center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as our trio moved away from Bruna her whole being burst into balls
        of light. "That lucky..."I mouthed silently.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Did you guys see? She was saved by professor Farald's creation."Milo
        practically shouted in my ear.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah, we saw. Now just hope it's not just morons that machine saves."I
        partly threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey away was less enthusiastic then our entrance. With a person
        less our group of three might be those with good odd's when rated alone
        against the other participants but they could form larger groups then
        us. My internal thoughts were interrupted by Jarvia saying "Your metal
        element is far more versatile then you showed in practice. Where do you
        even hide it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have practiced since we met up on the outside. As for were I keep my
        metal, that's a trade secret."I replied back with a small smile, I was
        glad she was worried.
      </p>
      <p>
        After losing Bruna we just wondered the jungle for awhile, there was not
        as many traces of the other students as I had originally hoped. The
        first person we came across was a water mage. A girl. Non of us knew her
        name, maybe I was feeling a bit angry about Bruna's actions cost me, but
        I did not let her die fast. The rules said we had to defeat the other
        students, it didn't really say what we could not do. It's not like
        Jarvia or Milo could complain, who would they tell? When I win it's not
        like they can do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My spirits picked up after our first hunt as a group, even if the others
        did not. We found a few other students after that. All alone. Boys and
        girls, I offered to wait around for Jarvia to release some stress if she
        wanted but she declined. Non of them turned into light before dying.
        They became food for the monsters of the jungle. They must be stuffed
        full by now, maybe that is why we were never attacked again.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the day went on, I was getting a little hungry. Not hungry enough to
        try eating anything in the jungle. They said the event's area would
        slowly close in so we would not be in here more then a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jarvia was the type to get angry when she was hungry. She snapped at
        anything we did that annoyed her. I told her she should take her
        stresses out on our enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The afternoon was more mellow. The hunger had passed and now we were
        just gently strolling around. No matter were we passed by there was no
        other groups, just single people fighting each other. Everyone was
        either tired or panicked when they saw us, it was really easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess our overseers also thought it was a little to easy. The weather
        was perfectly calm, the undisturbed ecosystem under the blanket cover of
        tall trees. With no notice, a sandstorm, something unnatural, magical,
        whipped though the jungle. The fallen pieces crept along the ground like
        spilled water, as the fierce winds splattered our faces with yellow
        specks causing us to go blind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Covering our faces with our hands we ran though the jungle seeking
        shelter. If there was to be any cliffs they would be on the edge of the
        area we could go and likely this was a sign that area was getting
        smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when we stumbled across a small cave entrance,tucked between some
        tree’s and covered by hanging moss. It was Jarvia who stumbled across it
        really. She tripped over and fell though the foliage which covered
        it,when she did not come back out right away Milo poked his head though
        and let me know it was a cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was perfect to hide out this little sand storm. The sand warped and
        wrapped by the hanging foliage, piled up neatly on the floor, unable to
        whip around inside so freely as it had outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cave was perfect. There was no creeping tree roots for Jarvia to
        fashion into her infamous spears. We each lit small mana balls in our
        hands to see. Red, Green or Silver light lighting our figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was not much to see in the cave,it was just plain rocks. Maybe
        further down, there could be metal deposits. Without an earth-mage
        between us it would be hard to shift though the rock and find anything
        useful, but any metal would help me. Sitting around waiting out the
        storm was not productive anyway, and as is known, those who don’t try
        can never win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Milo & Jarvia tagged along as I explored deeper into the cave. Non of it
        interested me. Rocks, cracks, drips. I found a small alcove with nothing
        there. We had only walked for a minute or two before finding the end of
        the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right at the back of the cave was an impure manaball. It was blue with
        flecks of purple swimming around inside. It was the kink of purple mana
        we all started with as mages. I had never heard of mage who’s element
        did not combine fully with their mana,but I guess these kind of mages
        never do anything worth writing down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The light showed not a single figure but two. Intertwined. People acted
        strange with their life on the line. They scrambled for their
        robes,wands or whatever else they had with them when I formed a shield
        from my mana. It looked and felt like real metal every time. It had cost
        me serval spell points to unlock but it was like my mother had shown
        me,only hers was bigger and more solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guard yourself, so that you can enact revenge. Those were my mothers
        words. Gods only know what words the mother left these two, and the
        God’s would be the only one’s to know what their thoughts were as I ran
        and slammed it into them. I smashed the girls head against the rocks at
        the back of the cave. It cracked and squelched. The boy roared tears and
        held his hand over my face, pouring water into my eyes, nose and mouth.
        He held his hand firm clinging to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not hit him with my shield. I tried to drag him off me, pull his
        hand away, but I couldn’t. He held tight. I thought I might breath in
        the water any moment. I slammed my body into the wall trying to shake
        him off me. I held my breath wondering what Milo & Jarvia were doing
        this whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't want to do this, but he left me no choice. I broke the metal
        shield down and let it mix back into my mana inside me. I then pushed
        the mana though my back and into the boy's body. This was a spell that
        my family taught me. The metal would wrap the target and push it away
        from you, guarding you, however each time the target struggled against
        it it would drain my mana. This was my last resort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only being level one the force was no that strong but it was enough to
        help pry him from my face and let me take in a breath of air. I felt my
        mana drain from me for a moment, as the boy pushed back but then it
        suddenly stopped. Jarvia as stood to his side with a root made spear
        sitting though his side. "You ran in without informing your team mates.
        You're lucky I found a root around here." She said to me, pulling the
        spear out of his side, splashing blood on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to retort, all I could do was breath heavily. Milo was kneeling
        over the girl, his hand in front of her nose & mouth. "She's not
        breathing." He said. He was not made for this game.
      </p>
      <Garin>
        "Let's just use this place to sit out the sand storm. I mean, not like
        they were doing." I joked. It landed flat.

        The first day was the worst. After running into the jungle, I vomited,
        became dizzy and cried. I just kept thinking 'put one foot in front of
        the other', careful not to trip and fall on tree roots.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        The plants that were my height were mostly soft large green foliage, it
        was easy to run though but made it hard to see far. I didn't rest, when
        I could not run, I walked.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        I just wanting to get further away. If I couldn't see them when I looked
        back, they could not see me either. The further I got from the middle,
        the safer I felt. It was silly really, no where was really safe. I guess
        my best outcome is to hope I run into no one else until near the end, so
        my chances of being saved by professor Farald are higher.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        As I neared the edge of the arena, I knew it was the edge because of
        tall wall of earth towering over the trees looming over me. Atop roamed
        little figures, I assumed were the staff responsible for this event. The
        Military and the academy staff. They were so high up it was impossible
        to make out any details about them.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        I kept moving until I stood at the foot of this wall. It felt cold under
        its shadow. The soil looked like it could be scrapped apart by hand,
        however when I pressed my hand against it, it felt as hard as any wall
        in the academy, not something I could just dig out. I stood staring at
        the wall for awhile, before slumping down against it.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        The staff had said they expected this event to only last a few days at
        most. The objective was for a student to be the last one standing. I had
        a lot of time to think about these rules during my time with ????. The
        last one standing did not mean the person who beat everyone else in
        combat. It did not even mean the last two had to even fight each other.
        What if I just hide really well? How long could I hide for? What would I
        need. Water and food and a place to hide.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        The staff of course had though about people hiding at the edge of the
        arena and said it would slowly become smaller as the contestants
        dwindled.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        It was not a sure fire plan, but, it was what I was going to do. Run and
        hide until I was the last. I just had to make it out of here, to see my
        dad again.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        Water and food. This jungle was not a baron wasteland it was a lush
        green jungle, the ferns stood as tall as me all around there must be an
        abundance of water and food here.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        Water was the most important, with my fire magic I could boil the water
        and therefore somewhat purify the food. The easiest way to find water
        was by following animals. The staff said they only killed monsters they
        deemed as too threatening so presumably they left the harmless animals
        alone. If I could not find any animals before the afternoon I would try
        and get water from vines to keep myself going and attempt to find more
        water tomorrow.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        Hopefully the water sources are not busy today, since most people will
        be hiding or fighting, hopefully not many came all the way to the edge
        of the arena. Hopefully.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        I had only been walking around for two hours when I stumbled across a
        small pond. It was sitting in an opening, fed by a small stream and
        leaving from another. It was barely a pond, more of a large puddle.
        Still it was water. I did a quick check over my shoulder and around the
        edge of the pond and saw no one. Quickly, I dove out and scooped up the
        water up in a water skin bottle. It was a basic item before going
        exploring, only those who never planned to venture far from the comfort
        of their own homes would not carry them constantly.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        Right. With that done, I need to find a place I can boil the water, I
        could try to boil it in the pond but the water would just flow down
        stream, never really heating up to a boiling point. If I boil it in my
        bottle I might have an accident involving the bottle.
      </Kaja>
      <Kaja>
        Just as my thoughts had start to wonder from me I was pulled back to
        reality by the sound of a breaking twig.
