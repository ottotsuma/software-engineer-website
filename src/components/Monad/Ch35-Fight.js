      <h4>Fight!</h4>
      <p>
        The days had gone by since I was released. Chu-gong
        had stayed down there after I left. I didn't offer to meet up with him after, I already had one guy act nice to me just to throw it in my face in the
        same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hands slipped across my robe as I rubbed the sweat off them. I thought I knew everything that was going to happen before the battle started, maybe I missed something in that meeting I was removed from but now I stood here in a small cage the overwhelming feeling was that I was not ready.
