      <h4>Fight!</h4>
      <p>
        The days had gone by since I was released. Chu-gong had stayed down
        there after I left. I didn't offer to meet up with him after, I already
        had one guy act nice to me just to throw it in my face in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hands slipped across my robe as I rubbed the sweat off them. I
        thought I knew everything that was going to happen before the battle
        started, maybe I missed something in that meeting I was removed from but
        now I stood here in a small cage of earth the overwhelming feeling was
        that I was not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around were many other similar cages holding other students inside. The
        earth element was one of the most common elements a mage could get.
        Since that was the case many of the students, staff and mage-soldiers
        used this element. There were extensive records though trial and error
        on what worked best so making these individual sized cages was barely an
        inconvenience to these train mages.
      </p>
      <p>
        While waiting one of the kinder teachers stood up on a make-shift podium
        held up by the earth elements rocks. Lubin, a teacher I only knew of who
        my own teachers spoke of as someone who taught them how to teach. He
        climbed up and stood atop the rocks, an earth mage would just cast it
        under themselves so he must not be an earth mage himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Everyone. Now we are out of the ears of the audience, I will explain
        some things that previously I would of been unable to tell you. To
        start, the reason for the emphasis on the possibility of dieing. This is
        not the inside of the arena, or one of the training areas. The magic
        that usually teleports a student out in the event of low HP is not
        installed as robustly as in the arena. For the shaper ones among you,
        yes, that means it is installed but there is a much, much, higher risk
        of you not being saved."
      </p>
      {/* Gu poison */}
      {/*10,000 students per year. 36 students in a class, 278 classes? Well that is for the combat roles but not all students are combat. */}
      <p>
        "The final thing I want to tell you is why. The real reason why. Every
        year around this time we normally hold duels. The result of these duels
        going towards your final grade. The academy lets the military see these
        results every year. The records show that almost all students at the
        bottom by this point in the year do not preform well later on. Dieing
        early or becoming a burden is the usual outcome for students at the
        bottom who join the military."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now you might say that's fine not all students want to join the
        military, maybe you don't want to join. I am sorry to break to this to
        you now but there is to be a policy change in Alden. All students will
        join the military after graduation. In the future all students at the
        academy will be considered as part of the military also."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So back to the main reason. Do you know what Gu Poison is? Well the
        idea is something like sealing several venomous creatures inside a
        closed container, where they devoured one another, the final creature
        being the most venomous. If you need motivation to be the most venomous
        here. The chances of you dieing is high. Very high. The winner however
        will be rewarded far beyond what their classmates will receive. Good
        luck to you all."
      </p>
      {/* Showing of the arena and the contestants inside the jungle or walking to the area? */}
      <p>
        Lubin had left my sight and I couldn't help but ponder on what he said.
        They had set up a similar mechanism to save the students if their HP got
        to low but it was barely functional? I had been in the arena most more
        then most first years and everyone in the dueling club knew the
        mechanisms of the arena were found in the state they are today, not made
        by anyone from Alden. Where they using us as test subjects?
      </p>
      <p>
        My disgust at the academy would have to wait though, as the earth cages
        crumbled each of us. The area we were fighting in was the jungles to the
        east of the academy. They were usually thick with trees but a clearing
        had been made to house us for the start of the event. More then 270
        students were chosen as class champions, making the start a hectic wash
        of of colorful spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the students were a little slow or stunned like me at first. I
        had thought there was going to be a count down or something! I wrapped
        myself in a fire cyclone, a spell that would damage anyone who got too
        close to me. The first thing I was doing was running into the trees as
        fast as I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ground was moving and shifting under the wishes of the earth mages,
        the wind shot one way and then the other under the control of the wind
        mages. I kept putting one foot in front of the other, pushing though the
        freezing and burning changes I felt on my skin. I was almost at the edge
        of the jungle when a dull pain stuck the side of my skull, it rang
        around my head, bouncing inside as I fell to the floor. I braced myself
        with my hands but my head was so dizzy it hurt my wrist when I landed.
        On the floor next to where I fell was a rock held together by earth
        mana, it quickly fell back into dirt, the mage that cast it must be off
        knocked out, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt a warm liquid flow from my head and 'pa-ta' on to the ground. My
        vision was a little blurry but it was blood. I looked up and could see
        the trees so close to me so I pushed all my effort into my legs placing
        on in front of the other and ran into the tree line and deep into the
        jungle. I told myself over and over, 'don't stop'.
      </p>

        {/* 'Fans' making bets and saying the most retarded things you can think of */}
        "Did you see that!? That blonde girl almost died without doing anything.
        She just ran from the start." - Student A
      </p>
      {/* Kaja was a little shorter then me, dark blonde hair and dark blue eyes */}
      <p>
        "Nah, I ain't gonna spend my time watching losers. Check out the middle
        of the field, it's like a king of the hill. So many people died. The
        first person was teleported out but I haven't see another get so lucky."
        - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Damn there is a pile of them there. Do you think they all died already?
        Surely they are just knocked out." - Student A
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't think they are knocked out. Look that body just got set on fire
        and didn't twitch at all. They're dead." - Student B
      </p>
      <p>"Feels kind weird. It was so fast it doesnâ€™t feel real you know?"</p>
      {/* Some retard teacher explaining retarded rules */}
      <p>
        "It's like the teacher said though, it's just the class rejects they
        wouldn't of amounted to much anyway. Don't worry so much." - Student A
      </p>
      {/* The start of the event with people running away, retards running for the middle to battle out the 'strongest' */}
      <p>
        "Sir, why were we asked to vote on class representatives? Wouldn't it be
        better to use our test scores?" - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Huh? It's because the students know each other better then the teachers
        can. There are so many of you it was more efficient to let the students
        single out their weakest members. Yes, some stronger members might of
        volunteered for the role, but these kind of psychopaths who jump at the
        chance to murder are hardly suitable candidates to be your team mates.
        Just relax and sit back in the knowledge if it is their fate to die they
        did not drag you down with them." - Teacher
      </p>
      <p>"Wait, wait. Look over there, isn't that Garin?"</p> - Student A
      <p>
        "Oh shit yeah! I saw him on the lists, he's one of the favorites to
        win." - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Lists? What are you boys talking about? Are the students placing bets
        on this?" - Teacher
      </p>
      <p>
        "Err, yeah. It's on the academy board. I thought the teachers knew about
        it since it's on the public board." - Student B
      </p>
      <p>
        "Honestly, it's all kind of alien to us. But I want in, help me place a
        bet." The teacher replied.

      {/* Going for a 3rd party viewer, history style because of the people watching the game. */}
      <p>
        Garin had gathered a small group around him. Fighting alone, even the
        strongest would lose a fight to a group of people. Forming alliances are
        an important aspect of survival, by helping each other stay alive they
        eliminate small groups of competitors around them giving them better
        odd's at winning.

        eliminate small groups of competitors around them giving them better
        odd's at winning.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Garin was considered the strongest mage in the group,the other
        members were no burdens. Once the list of oddâ€™s was posted and bets
        started to be made,this group started to form of students likely to win.
        Their goal was simple,eliminate those with lower oddâ€™s,there by
        increasing their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group was made of 9,it was too large not to splinter. Non of the
        participants were of noble birth,however that did not make them weak.
        Garin and Jarvia were actually the top in the class and were voted in so
        their class would win.
      </p>
      <p>
        The starting battle had been a hectic brawl,the students had gone though
        a fight of flight from the start. Water magic had clashed with fire
        making the air in this clearing humid. The earth magic had reshaped the
        land below their feet into an uneven mess with pillars and large rocks
        littering the landscape. There were no blood mages present,still the
        rocks were stained a burnt maroon,the water still mixed with the crimson
        liquid in places.
      </p>
      <p>
        What had started as a small group of nine in a sea of students and
        spells,was now whittled down to four. It was hard to say how many had
        been saved and removed from the arena by professor Faraldâ€™s creation.
        The four of their like laying at their feet could tempt them to say it
        was one-in-five. The litany of corpses decorating the field like a
        morbid pumpkin patch seemed to scream in disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many had run into the woods? How many had died running there? How
        many had stayed to fight? No one knew right now. It was safe to say more
        then half of those who had entered were morbid decorations now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jarvia was the first to speak. "The rest ran into the woods. We should
        hunt down as many as we can before they form groups."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shouldnâ€™t we rest? I mean look..." Milo replied trailing off into a
        blank stare across the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The longer we rest,the more they rest. Do you want to be a burn to the
        group?" Garin added.
      </p>
      <p>"It was just a suggestion." Milo replied.</p>
      <p>
        "Donâ€™t worry so much. Although that fight was hard,now they are alone.
        The oneâ€™s who ran at the start were cowards. Now we can hunt them down
        leisurely and have some fun." Garin laughed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to say don't underestimate a foe but even I agree those who did
        not fight here are just cowards. It will be easy for us to clean up."
        Jarvia smirked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Garin checked his status. 30% HP and almost depleted all my mana. Iâ€™ll
        make Milo take care of the weak ones while I recover. I canâ€™t let Jarvia
        know Iâ€™m weak right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment we left the center the air air felt fresher,less humid. I
        felt dizzy suddenly. Hot bile bubbled up from my core,coating my tongue.
        I couldnâ€™t hold it in and vomited onto the floor. Jarvia stared at me,so
        I spoke between breaths. "The jungle really smells." She didnâ€™t reply
        first, Bruna did who had been quiet up until now. She also spewed hot
        sick onto a fern.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mmm" Milo hummed. He was pale but that was it. I spat on the ground and
        walked forward my head up high. The jungle was free and wild,the canopy
        of trees blocked out most of the sunlight,however it was not dark. Small
        plants brushed up against our ankles. Our robes kept all other wandering
        feelers of the jungle from our skin,aside from the bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The small flying bugs would find their way to biting and stinging us no
        matter the location. Bruna wasted mana batting them away from her until
        she was reprimanded by Jarvia. I could see how it was,the girls were
        going to stick together in the end. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t tire Milo out too
        much.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first person we found who had run from the start had become
        nourishment for a swarm of green flying beetles. They were each the side
        of an adults hand and crawled across his body ripping off chunks of
        flesh and bone in their pincers. The sound squished like stepping in on
        wet moss before an abrupt loud crunching sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teachers had told us they would clear up the worst and largest of
        the monsters but would and could not keep all of them out. We were lucky
        they were feeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Elsa?" Bruna said looking over. All I saw was monsters and chunks of
        flesh. "It's Elsa, she was in my sculpting class. She use to make the
        most beautiful mini ice castles with her magic." Bruna told to the bugs?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I guess she was one of the unlucky ones." I said, not really sure
        what to say, and immediately realised I should of said nothing when
        Bruna burst into tears. It was the kind of sobbing that wrenched at your
        heart strings. "Come on Bruna, you knew how this would end of most of
        the people in this." I said to try and shake her into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's different when it's someone you know." Bruna chocked back though
        sobs. She lifted the muddy earth from around her feet and bombarded the bugs around Elsa with a brown hail.
