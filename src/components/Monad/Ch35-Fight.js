      <h4>Fight!</h4>
      <p>
        The days had gone by since I was released. Chu-gong had stayed down
        there after I left. I didn't offer to meet up with him after, I already
        had one guy act nice to me just to throw it in my face in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hands slipped across my robe as I rubbed the sweat off them. I
        thought I knew everything that was going to happen before the battle
        started, maybe I missed something in that meeting I was removed from but
        now I stood here in a small cage of earth the overwhelming feeling was
        that I was not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around were many other similar cages holding other students inside. The
        earth element was one of the most common elements a mage could get.
        Since that was the case many of the students, staff and mage-soldiers
        used this element. There were extensive records though trial and error
        on what worked best so making these individual sized cages was barely an
        inconvenience to these train mages.
      </p>
      <p>
        While waiting one of the kinder teachers stood up on a make-shift podium
        held up by the earth elements rocks. Lubin, a teacher I only knew of who
        my own teachers spoke of as someone who taught them how to teach. He
        climbed up and stood atop the rocks, an earth mage would just cast it
        under themselves so he must not be an earth mage himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Everyone. Now we are out of the ears of the audience, I will explain
        some things that previously I would of been unable to tell you. To
        start, the reason for the emphasis on the possibility of dieing. This is
        not the inside of the arena, or one of the training areas. The magic
        that usually teleports a student out in the event of low HP is not
        installed as robustly as in the arena. For the shaper ones among you,
        yes, that means it is installed but there is a much, much, higher risk
        of you not being saved."
      </p>
      {/* Gu poison */}
      {/*10,000 students per year. 36 students in a class, 278 classes? Well that is for the combat roles but not all students are combat. */}
      <p>
        "The final thing I want to tell you is why. The real reason why. Every
        year around this time we normally hold duels. The result of these duels
        going towards your final grade. The academy lets the military see these
        results every year. The records show that almost all students at the
        bottom by this point in the year do not preform well later on. Dieing
        early or becoming a burden is the usual outcome for students at the
        bottom who join the military."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now you might say that's fine not all students want to join the
        military, maybe you don't want to join. I am sorry to break to this to
        you now but there is to be a policy change in Alden. All students will
        join the military after graduation. In the future all students at the
        academy will be considered as part of the military also."
      </p>
      <p>
        "So back to the main reason. Do you know what Gu Poison is? Well the
        idea is something like sealing several venomous creatures inside a
        closed container, where they devoured one another, the final creature
        being the most venomous. If you need motivation to be the most venomous
        here. The chances of you dieing is high. Very high. The winner however
        will be rewarded far beyond what their classmates will receive. Good
        luck to you all."
      </p>
      {/* Showing of the arena and the contestants inside the jungle or walking to the area? */}
      <p>
        Lubin had left my sight and I couldn't help but ponder on what he said.
        They had set up a similar mechanism to save the students if their HP got
        to low but it was barely functional? I had been in the arena most more
        then most first years and everyone in the dueling club knew the
        mechanisms of the arena were found in the state they are today, not made
        by anyone from Alden. Where they using us as test subjects?
      </p>
      <p>
        My disgust at the academy would have to wait though, as the earth cages
        crumbled each of us. The area we were fighting in was the jungles to the
        east of the academy. They were usually thick with trees but a clearing
        had been made to house us for the start of the event. More then 270
        students were chosen as class champions, making the start a hectic wash
        of of colorful spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the students were a little slow or stunned like me at first. I
        had thought there was going to be a count down or something! I wrapped
        myself in a fire cyclone, a spell that would damage anyone who got too
        close to me. The first thing I was doing was running deep into the trees as fast as I could.

      {/* Some retard teacher explaining retarded rules */}
      {/* The start of the event with people running away, retards running for the middle to battle out the 'strongest' */}
      {/* tracking of students through the jungles */}
      {/* Dumb 'events' */}
      {/* More dumb student banter */}
      {/* Cornering students and beating them to death */}
