      <h4>Fight!</h4>
      <p>
        The days had gone by since I was released. Chu-gong had stayed down
        there after I left. I didn't offer to meet up with him after, I already
        had one guy act nice to me just to throw it in my face in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hands slipped across my robe as I rubbed the sweat off them. I
        thought I knew everything that was going to happen before the battle
        started, maybe I missed something in that meeting I was removed from but
        now I stood here in a small cage of earth the overwhelming feeling was
        that I was not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around were many other similar cages holding other students inside. The
        earth element was one of the most common elements a mage could get.
        Since that was the case many of the students, staff and mage-soldiers
        used this element. There were extensive records though trial and error
        on what worked best so making these individual sized cages was barely an
        inconvenience to these train mages.
