          <p>
            The results day was here. While this day was officially part of our
            schedule as students and not a day off, the only things on the
            agenda was to receive our ranking, find out the results of the first
            tournament and be introduced to some training area's first years
            could access. For those wanting to progress as a combat mage these
            training areas were where we would spend most of out rest days
            anyway. Or so I was told by the others.
          </p>

          <p>
            With around 10,000 students in each year. Give or take the amount of
            students coming and going abroad and children born in that year. The
            true number could only be found out through the academy's records,
            and I don't have time for that. Plus there are many students like
            Tisiel who have opted out of combat already and more will come. I
            was just trying to psych myself up, just incase my ranking was in
            thousands.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I got to class we were handed slips of paper, and then asked to
            sit down. At the top was our rank, and below options to pick from
            for future classes. We had our mage classes for everyone, these
            cannot be avoided. Element class for each element, job class for
            what you want to become in the future and finally a club. Right now
            people where allowed to change their job class and start joining
            clubs.
          </p>

          <p>
            My rank? B-1. Guess I won't be finding out how many students took
            the combat exam anytime soon. I guess it would be hard to rank them
            with numbers anyway since it was only 2 matches. I took a quick look
            at the club list, but since most of the clubs where normal sports
            and the only interest I had was killing monsters & finding treasure
            I guess I would see what other people picked before handing it in
            next week.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ahem, next week you will be taking your first missions outside of
            the academy. You can only take missions that match your rank. Since
            the ranking system you can only take Blue ranked missions, within
            that should be your broken down ranks. For example rank A, B, C, D
            and so on. The 1 on the end is just to indicate your year. Finally,
            and most important. READ THE MISSION DESCRIPTION. There is not point
            taking a medical mission if you do not have the skill to complete
            it. The rank is just to indicate the level of danger." Lubin said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Now while I am suppose to show you all which training areas you can
            use as first years. Not everyone here is interested in the same
            things, so up on the board is a quick sketch of the school and where
            you can find the various club rooms and training areas. The combat
            training area is next to the arena. Hard to miss. Class dismissed."
            And with that he left the room quickly, he must of wanted to get off
            work early.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without waiting around for the others I headed straight for the
            arena. Tisiel and Ralsan where non combat classes anyway from the
            cliff side only Reingard and Shrorlei would be going to the arena
            and they where not in my mage class anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            The training areas where all around the arena. Students where
            crowded around stone pillars and tablets on the floor. There was no
            one training though, and just stood around, and there was no where
            to really train. I walked over to one of the stone pillars with
            students all around it talking. Next to it was a stone tablet which
            read: "Test of Magic Defense. The longer you survive the higher your
            ranking will be." Huh.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You touch the pillar if you wanna try it. If you rank highly you
            might get rewards from the academy at the end of each month. Things
            like this though don't really get rewarded you have to do the
            combat, command, monster and dueling trials to get any real
            rewards." A teacher said talking to the other students. "Look for
            the biggest pillars if you want to try your hand at them."
          </p>

          <p>
            With that handy piece of information Lubin forgot to mention I
            headed over to a more crowded area by one of the biggest pillars.
            Monster Hunting Trial. Collect tokens from killing monsters, the
            monsters in this trial drop tokens on their death the more your
            trade in the higher your rank.
          </p>

          <p>
            It turned out each of these major training areas had different
            measures to rank up, dueling was straight forward ranks, you take
            the rank of the person you beat, and where matched randomly to
            someone near the same rank as you. Command you where rewarded for
            completing objectives and combat for how long you survive. I touched
            the monster stone and accepted the request that popped up.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was transported into a rainforest. There where a few students
            stood around here wooden boxes dotted about where the tokens could
            be deposited later. I did not want to spend too long thinking about
            how all this was possible, there are so many different kind of
            magics it was not worth it, the pop up that appeared before me was a
            count down timer, each student could only spend 1 hour in here per
            day so I had to get a move on.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found a large green monster after awhile of running around. It had
            spikes down its back and walked on all fours, with a bird beak like
            face but larger and a long tail where the spikes continue down to
            the bottom. I ran up to it from the flank out of the trees and swung
            my warhammer into its back leg. As I would find out later I was
            luckily enough that this monster was an adolescent and not a fully
            grown adult, as adolescents have high magic defense but poor
            physical defense where the adults do not.
          </p>

          <p>
            The monster was young, it screamed in pain and turned its back away
            from me and tried to come after me with its beak like head. I shot
            lightning magic towards its face and chased down its read end. I
            swung the warhammer into its rear leg over and over, soon the thing
            was crippled and although I was able to kill it I had used a lot of
            my mana and stamina.
          </p>

          <p>
            The hour went pretty well, I hunted smaller monsters after that,
            jumping them from surprise with lighting speed and hitting them with
            a combination of physical and magical attacks. All of the tokens I
            got where wooden which made some sense to me and I headed back to
            the starting point before the time run out fully.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I made it back inside I saw a group of students up ahead,
            they shouted out to me. "Hey you. You're alone? That's good. Give us
            all your tokens." The three of them stood before me, the one in the
            middle with blonde curly hair, the only problem was all the grease
            in his hair.
          </p>

          <p>"What? why?" I questioned</p>

          <p>
            "Because you where unfortunate enough to come in at the same time as
            us. Now hand them over or we will beat you until you are teleported
            out." Now he started to look angry as if I was just wasting his time
            and he had other people to rob.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You can have this instead." With that I pulled out my warhammer and
            hit him in the knee caps. He went straight down and his friends
            behind him shot a lump of rock into my chest in return. I was too
            slow to dodge it and it felt like my chest caved in.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hit him harder then that Ditwin." The boy who's leg I had hit said
            as he was crawling back.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- Gelfrat (water) --> */}

          <p>
            I shot lightning towards him but it was blocked by an earth wall.
            Jets of water come shooting back from the other one and hit me in my
            leg, arm, chest, face. With the combined assault I soon saw a white
            light take me over and teleport me out. I knew from the school guide
            you could not die inside the training grounds but maybe that was a
            waste to make enemies as powerful as that. Then again if I did not
            fight back they would see me as a push over. I checked my storage
            and all of my tokens where gone.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You got unlucky I see, Linhart's group just went inside. 3rd years.
            A few others came out and told us what they where doing inside
            already." A student said the moment I came out.
          </p>

          <p>"I thought only first years could go inside there?" I replied.</p>

          <p>
            "Ah no, these are training grounds first years can use. Not
            exclusively for first years." The student replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            I nodded. Not much I could do about it then. It really sucked. I
            wasted 1 hour in there with nothing to show for it. I wanted to take
            my anger out on something so since there was a magic defense
            training ground there must be one for strength. At least I would do
            well in a school full of mages at that.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found it shortly after. Thinking back on what happened there was
            nothing else I could of done, even the idea of getting revenge was
            silly. They where 3rd years, I was only a first year I could never
            make up the difference in years even when I became that old they
            would always be older. But I was still angry.
          </p>

          <p>
            The strength challenge was easy, touch the totem go inside and hit a
            giant drum with all your strength. I scored 12. Which matched my
            strength stat so they must be linked to that. Once I left the trial
            I checked the pillar outside where names written on it with scores
            next to them. A message appeared in front of me when I inspected the
            pillar.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Congratulations on making it into the top 1% for this years
            students so far! You are rank 4!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Congratulations on making it into the top 10% for this academy's
            students so far! You are rank 612!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Congratulations on making it into the top 90% for all this years
            students so far! You are rank 827412!"
          </p>

          <p>
            A good reminder that although my strength was high for a mage,
            especially for a first year. It was very low compared to the Fighter
            and Rogue students. Rank over 8 million!? This test cannot be
            limited to just Alden it seems. On top of all that the academic year
            is still early.
          </p>

          <p>
            "12!? Your gear must be really expensive, most gear with strength
            stats are expensive and usually only fighters use them!" A student
            half shouted from behind me.
          </p>

          <p>"Ah, it's not gear, that is just my strength." I replied</p>

          <p>
            "Eh? All 12 of it is is your base strength!?" He said a little
            confused.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh no! Sorry I mean I do have some gear, this warhammer adds +1. My
            base strength is 11."
          </p>

          <p>
            "11? You mean you invested points into strength? Are you the guy I
            heard about from the arena? I am not sure that it will pay off..
            Most strength mages only invest in strength at a later stage for
            equipment or role reasons. Good luck" He said as he walked off back
            to his friends.
          </p>

          {/* <!-- 11 from level, +1 from warhammer,  --> */}

          <p>
            Urgh, today was not going how I wanted but there was two more trials
            I wanted to try. Dueling and Combat. But since today was going so
            badly I decided to head back to the cliff side. I would try them
            another day.
