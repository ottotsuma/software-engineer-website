          <h4>Tisiel's Note</h4>

          <p>
            Having gotten Tisiel's letter I was standing in front of the giant
            circular door waiting for her. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she
            had stayed up all night again.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "So you made a big break though?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yes, I am sure we can open this door"</p>
          <p>Otto - "How?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and
            ask me to marry you. Simple right?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "The door shall forever remain a mystery, no one will ever
            know what was behind it. Shame really."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke, but seriously
            though we can open the door, we just have to read this passage
            together out loud and combine the wand with the ring."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Alright let's get this over with, these better not be
            wedding vows."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It was a joke.."</p>

          <p>
            Together the we read off a translated a version of the passage from
            the book, the sounds don't fit quite together as they should but
            still the doors symbols glow red like the ring. As instructed I
            placed the wand though the ring Tisiel is holding and we both passed
            mana though, sure enough the circles began to rotate. Soon the door
            seem to disappear like it was never there, confused the we just look
            at each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Hold up, I had to put my wand in your ring? I bet this is a
            sex dungeon after all."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ohh, how about a wager. If its a sex dungeon I will buy
            you dinner. If not, you buy you dinner."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Aha you are on, now get your butt in the creepy sex
            dungeon."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Good thing no one else is around.."</p>

          <p>
            Stepping inside we found stairs leading down into darkness, lighting
            up mana balls to float around us, we make their way down to the
            bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, was a desk, book
            shelves and a chest of draws. There were lots of books, a large blue
            orb giving off a little light and skulls. Many, many skulls. They
            lined the book shelves with books leaning against them, they where a
            few on the desk, the chest of draws where full of skulls.
          </p>

          <div class="pop">
            Room
            <img
              class="popOut"
              src="https://ottotsuma.github.io/images/wizroom.jpg"
              height="400px"
              alt="Room"
            />
          </div>

          <p>Otto - "You owe me dinner."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - ".. This is NOT a sex dungeon!"</p>
          <p>Otto - "I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Phahaha, you freak. Get looking for loot."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah alright"</p>

          <p>
            While Tisiel was looking though the books I whipped out my wand and
            looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remained as
            they where, except from the orb the only items in the room which
            glowed where; the quill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up
            in a corner, a pendent on top of the chess of draws and one of the
            skulls on the book shelf. I took these items and placed them on the
            desk together. When Tisiel had finished looking though the books and
            taking the ones she liked in a small pile on the desk we decided to
            go though what we had found.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Think you can work out what these items do?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Well yeah, given time I am sure I can do a few of them,
            lets take these things out of here and back to my room we can go
            over what we have."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Yeah, even though I've been joking about this place, I don't
            want to spend too long down here." With that we went back to
            Tisiel's room to search though what we had found, after all this
            place was kind of creepy.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Lets go over what we have, and how do we split it up?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for
            myself. Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and
            become a huge master of the realm"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "What are the chances that any of this stuff is even useful
            to you? And like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in
            your sex dungeon then."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGEON! .... I am not sure what it is
            yet, but maybe next time we go out I will bring someone else."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Ohhh who do you have in mind? Is it Reingard?" With that she
            went bright red, I felt kind of awkward then, I had no idea she even
            felt that way about him, or anyone. After all we had really only met
            recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "No no no .. I mean like, he's nice but this is all besides
            the point, you are already in this deep so you are coming next time
            even if you don't want to." She gave me an evil smile. I found the
            whole thing kind of funny, while we had just met I had to admit
            Tisiel was a much better friend then some of the kids from the
            village.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "The place looked like a study, private place to work, but
            why? I am sure I will get to the bottom of though though my studies.
            Anyway at this level it's less about finding specific magic
            treasures but building myself around what we have found. While we
            are not rich enough to buy treasures that match us we are young
            enough to pick skills going forward which match what we have."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "I am sure you will find out what was going on down there and
            drag me back in soon, honestly if you really wanted the items I
            would rather have a trust worthy partner then one or two magic items
            I am not sure I can even use. You are right, but I can't change my
            element so I hoping for lightning items!"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ohh, you trust me? That's new. I'll tell you what they do,
            well what I know then we take turns taking one each? That way if
            there is an item you can use you will pick it first."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Mmm that's more then fair, honestly the exams coming up and
            team matches, I am sure I will need someone to watch my back."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I would not count on me in a fight." She giggled.</p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Starting with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am
            unsure what else they can do but they seem to be symbols of the
            people that made the door, graveyard and lived in the ruined
            academy. I'd like to keep studying them..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the
            future I won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it
            counting as one of yours."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel nod's and continues - "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of
            the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your
            charisma, as well as increasing the number of undead you can
            control."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Creepy."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just
            does not care for their appearance and others."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, so it's perfect for you?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Tsst, I actually do want it, it is interesting but I do
            care how I look thank you very much."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will
            make a beautiful couple."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I.. What? Why do you say that!?"</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about
            why I keep coming into your room alone with you."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring
            increasing your control over the undead."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it
            comes with the skill animate stone. That explains the things that
            attacked us in the grave yard."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Finally the daughters coin, who though more research I am
            not sure is there daughter at all. I am not even sure if they are
            related and this coin is a mystery to me, can't find any references
            to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it contains."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive
            maybe it would be better to sell it?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's
            not like we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway
            the stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more
            then normal items but reduces your strength it's really popular
            among mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no
            negative effects, can't have you been to small."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Aha, I'll take them even if you are trying to get rid of
            that ring."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Hehe you saw though that. Next is the skull-"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It might be amazing."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a
            skull."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why do you care if people talk to you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Do you want the skull or not?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your
            magic. It's actually pretty good."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "And the quill?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Come on you don't want the quill."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ah, it helps your chances when etching enchantments on
            items"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "There is still the coin and tiara."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me
            dinner, I'm sure I was right about that sex dungeon."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "I will stab you to death with this quill if you mention
            that again."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Hehe, fine let's go eat. I would like to know what was going
            on down there though."
          </p>
          {/* Dinner - add transistion */}
          <p>
            We both headed downstairs and into the shared space to eat dinner
            with the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Tisiel it had slipped my mind, but I took notes on the
            history of these two mages from the main library, I think you might
            find them more useful then me reflecting on whats happened."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "On whats happened?" Looking at the titles and quickly
            skimming the contents of the book. "You know, you might be right,
            this looks exactly like the kind of inspiration I need for myself,
            mind if I copy this?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my
            room."
          </p>

          <p>Tisiel - "Ah that was my whole plan!"</p>
