          <h4>Tisiel's Note</h4>
          <p>
            Having gotten Tisiel's letter, I was standing in front of the giant
            circular door at the back of the cliffside waiting for her to
            arrive. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she had stayed up all night
            again. The dark circles under her eyes had dark circles under them.
          </p>
          <p>"So you made a big break though?" I asked as you approached.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, I am sure we can open this door" She replied looking
            delighted.
          </p>
          <p>"How?" I asked a little excited to see what was behind it.</p>
          <p>
            "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and ask me to
            marry you. Simple right?" She pulled out the ring we had used to get
            into the mausoleum a few days ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The door shall forever remain a mystery, no one will ever know what
            was behind it. Shame really." I replied coldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke! But seriously though we
            can open the door, we just have to read this passage out loud and
            combine the wand with the ring inside the door."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Alright I'll do it. These better not be wedding vows." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>"It was a joke.." She muttered.</p>
          <p>
            I placed the ring into the center most circle on the door. After I
            put the wand into the ring and pushed it until the wand had pieced
            deep into the door. "Hey, do you think it is a euphemism for sex?" I
            said pointing to the wand inside of the ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No! They just work together like a set of keys that are split up.
            Now be serious." She scalded. Tisiel read though the script as best
            she could. The language sounded clumsy but that might of just been
            Tisiel unfamiliarly with the sounds. Without having ever heard
            anyone speak the language it was a miracle she was even trying.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doors symbols glow red like the ring. After a short time the
            circles began to rotate, the outer most to the right, the middle to
            the left and the inner to the right. Once they reached a certain
            point each ring would stop and move some more in a random direction.
            Soon the door gave off a loud noise and started to disappear like it
            was never there. Confused the we just look at each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So, I had to put the kings wand in your ring? I bet this is a sex
            dungeon after all." I said as the door faded into nothing.
          </p>
          {/* what about the wand and the ring? */}
          <p>
            "Ohh, how about a wager? If its a sex dungeon I will buy you dinner.
            If not, you buy you dinner." She said with a crafty smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, fine, you are on, now get your butt in the creepy sex
            dungeon." I said laughing.
          </p>
          <p>"Good thing no one else is around.." She complained.</p>
          <p>
            Stepping inside we found stairs leading down into darkness. Lighting
            up mana balls to float around us, we made our way down to the
            bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, inside was, a desk with
            a large blue orb giving off some light, book shelves stacked with
            old books and skulls and a chest of draws.
          </p>
          <div className="pop">
            Room
            <img
              className="popOut"
              src="https://ottotsuma.github.io/images/wizroom.jpg"
              height="400px"
              alt="Room"
            />
          </div>
          <p>"You owe me dinner." I said after looking around the room.</p>
          <p>".. This is NOT a sex dungeon!" Tisiel shouted back.</p>
          <p>"I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls" I pointed out.</p>
          <p>
            "Phahaha, you freak. Get looking for loot." She laughed and moved
            into the room to search though the books.
          </p>
          <p>"Yeah alright" I said and went to look though the room also.</p>
          <p>
            While Tisiel was looking though the books, I whipped out my wand and
            looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remained as
            they where. The items in the room with mana still inside started to
            glow in my vision, apart from the glowing orb. It was already
            glowing so maybe it was a magic item?
          </p>
          <p>
            A quill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up in a corner, a
            pendent on top of the chess of draws and one of the skulls on the
            book shelf. I took these items and placed them on the desk together.
            When Tisiel had finished looking though the books and taking the
            ones she liked in a small pile on the desk we decided to go though
            what we had found.
          </p>
          <p>"Think you can work out what these items do?" I said looking at the small pile.</p>
          <p>"Well yeah. Given time, I am sure I can do a few of them.
          Lets take these things out of here and back to my room we can go
          over what we have." She said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, even though I've been joking about this place, I don't
            want to spend too long down here." With that we went back to
            Tisiel's room to search though what we had found, after all this
            place was kind of creepy.
          </p>
          {/* Break point? */}
          <p>Sitting down in Tisiel's room on her desk chair looking at the pile of items we had placed onto her bed I said "Lets go over what we have, and how do we split it up."</p>
          <p>
            "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for
            myself. Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and
            become a huge master of the realm" She laughed hugging a soft toy witch while sitting on her bed.
          </p>
          <p>"Like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in
            your sex dungeon then." I joked.
          </p>
          <p>"IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGEON! ...." Tisiel shouted. "I am not sure what it is
            yet, but maybe next time we go out I will bring someone else." She said looking away from me.
          </p>
          <p>"Ohhh who do you have in mind? Is it Reingard?" With that she
            went bright red, I felt kind of awkward then, I had no idea she even
            felt that way about him, or anyone. After all we had really only met
            recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "No no no .. I mean like, he's nice but this is all besides
            the point, you are already in this deep so you are coming next time
            even if you don't want to." She gave me an evil smile. I found the
            whole thing kind of funny, while we had just met I had to admit
            Tisiel was a much better friend then some of the kids from the
            village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "The place looked like a study, private place to work, but
            why? I am sure I will get to the bottom of though though my studies.
            Anyway at this level it's less about finding specific magic
            treasures but building myself around what we have found. While we
            are not rich enough to buy treasures that match us we are young
            enough to pick skills going forward which match what we have."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I am sure you will find out what was going on down there and
            drag me back in soon, honestly if you really wanted the items I
            would rather have a trust worthy partner then one or two magic items
            I am not sure I can even use. You are right, but I can't change my
            element so I hoping for lightning items!"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ohh, you trust me? That's new. I'll tell you what they do,
            well what I know then we take turns taking one each? That way if
            there is an item you can use you will pick it first."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Mmm that's more then fair, honestly the exams coming up and
            team matches, I am sure I will need someone to watch my back."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I would not count on me in a fight." She giggled.</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Starting with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am
            unsure what else they can do but they seem to be symbols of the
            people that made the door, graveyard and lived in the ruined
            academy. I'd like to keep studying them..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the
            future I won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it
            counting as one of yours."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel nod's and continues - "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of
            the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your
            charisma, as well as increasing the number of undead you can
            control."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Creepy."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just
            does not care for their appearance and others."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah, so it's perfect for you?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Tsst, I actually do want it, it is interesting but I do
            care how I look thank you very much."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will
            make a beautiful couple."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I.. What? Why do you say that!?"</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about
            why I keep coming into your room alone with you."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring
            increasing your control over the undead."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it
            comes with the skill animate stone. That explains the things that
            attacked us in the grave yard."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Finally the princesses coin, who though more research I am
            not sure if she was their daughter at all. I am not even sure if
            they are related and this coin is a mystery to me, can't find any
            references to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it
            contains."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive
            maybe it would be better to sell it?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's
            not like we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway
            the stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more
            then normal items but reduces your strength it's really popular
            among mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no
            negative effects, can't have you been to small."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Aha, I'll take them even if you are trying to get rid of
            that ring."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Hehe you saw though that. Next is the skull-"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yours."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "It might be amazing."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a
            skull."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why do you care if people talk to you?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Do you want the skull or not?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your
            magic. It's actually pretty good."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "And the quill?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Come on you don't want the quill."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ah, it helps your chances when etching enchantments on
            items"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "There is still the coin and tiara."</p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me
            dinner, I'm sure I was right about that sex dungeon."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "I will stab you to death with this quill if you mention
            that again."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Hehe, fine let's go eat. I would like to know what was going
            on down there though."
          </p>
          {/* Dinner - add transition */}
          <p>
            We both headed downstairs and into the shared space to eat dinner
            with the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Tisiel it had slipped my mind, but I took notes on the
            history of these two mages from the main library, I think you might
            find them more useful then me reflecting on whats happened."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "On whats happened?" Looking at the titles and quickly
            skimming the contents of the book. "You know, you might be right,
            this looks exactly like the kind of inspiration I need for myself,
            mind if I copy this?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my
            room."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Ah that was my whole plan!"</p>
