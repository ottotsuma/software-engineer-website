          <h4>Tisiel's Note</h4>
          <p>
            Having gotten Tisiel's letter, I was standing in front of the giant
            circular door at the back of the cliffside waiting for her to
            arrive. Tisiel soon arrived looking like she had stayed up all night
            again. The dark circles under her eyes had dark circles under them.
          </p>
          <p>"So you made a big break though?" I asked as you approached.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, I am sure we can open this door" She replied looking
            delighted.
          </p>
          <p>"How?" I asked a little excited to see what was behind it.</p>
          <p>
            "You just have to take this ring, get down on one knee and ask me to
            marry you. Simple right?" She pulled out the ring we had used to get
            into the mausoleum a few days ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The door shall forever remain a mystery, no one will ever know what
            was behind it. Shame really." I replied coldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puffing out her cheeks "It was just a joke! But seriously though we
            can open the door, we just have to read this passage out loud and
            combine the wand with the ring inside the door."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Alright I'll do it. These better not be wedding vows." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>"It was a joke.." She muttered.</p>
          <p>
            I placed the ring into the center most circle on the door. After I
            put the wand into the ring and pushed it until the wand had pieced
            deep into the door. "Hey, do you think it is a euphemism for sex?" I
            said pointing to the wand inside of the ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No! They just work together like a set of keys that are split up.
            Now be serious." She scalded. Tisiel read through the script as best
            she could. The language sounded clumsy but that might of just been
            Tisiel unfamiliarly with the sounds. Without having ever heard
            anyone speak the language it was a miracle she was even trying.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doors symbols glow red like the ring. After a short time the
            circles began to rotate, the outer most to the right, the middle to
            the left and the inner to the right. Once they reached a certain
            point each ring would stop and move some more in a random direction.
            Soon the door gave off a loud noise and started to disappear like it
            was never there. Confused the we just look at each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So, I had to put the kings wand in your ring? I bet this is a sex
            dungeon after all." I said as the door faded into nothing.
          </p>
          {/* what about the wand and the ring? */}
          <p>
            "Ohh, how about a wager? If its a sex dungeon I will buy you dinner.
            If not, you buy you dinner." She said with a crafty smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, fine, you are on, now get your butt in the creepy sex
            dungeon." I said laughing.
          </p>
          <p>"Good thing no one else is around.." She complained.</p>
          <p>
            Stepping inside we found stairs leading down into darkness. Lighting
            up mana balls to float around us, we made our way down to the
            bottom. At the bottom was a small dark room, inside was, a desk with
            a large blue orb giving off some light, book shelves stacked with
            old books and skulls and a chest of draws.
          </p>
          <div className="pop">
            Room
            <img
              className="popOut"
              src="https://ottotsuma.github.io/images/places/wizroom.jpg"
              height="400px"
              alt="Room"
            />
          </div>
          <p>"You owe me dinner." I said after looking around the room.</p>
          <p>".. This is NOT a sex dungeon!" Tisiel shouted back.</p>
          <p>"I dunno, mood lighting, sexy skulls" I pointed out.</p>
          <p>
            "Phahaha, you freak. Get looking for loot." She laughed and moved
            into the room to search through the books.
          </p>
          <p>"Yeah alright" I said and went to look through the room also.</p>
          <p>
            While Tisiel was looking through the books, I whipped out my wand and
            looked for magic items. Most of the objects in the room remained as
            they where. The items in the room with mana still inside started to
            glow in my vision, apart from the glowing orb. It was already
            glowing so maybe it was a magic item?
          </p>
          <p>
            A quill left on the table, a wizards hat screwed up in a corner, a
            pendent on top of the chess of draws and one of the skulls on the
            book shelf. I took these items and placed them on the desk together.
            When Tisiel had finished looking through the books and taking the
            ones she liked in a small pile on the desk we decided to go through
            what we had found.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Think you can work out what these items do?" I said looking at the
            small pile.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well yeah. Given time, I am sure I can do a few of them. Lets take
            these things out of here and back to my room we can go over what we
            have." She said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, even though I've been joking about this place, I don't want
            to spend too long down here." With that we went back to Tisiel's
            room to search through what we had found, after all this place was
            kind of creepy.
          </p>
          {/* Break point? */}
          <p>
            Sitting down in Tisiel's room on her desk chair looking at the pile
            of items we had placed onto her bed I said "Lets go over what we
            have, and how do we split it up."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, this is where I betray you, and steal all the loot for myself.
            Using the ill gotten goods I get propelled forward and become a huge
            master of the realm" She laughed hugging a soft toy witch while
            sitting on her bed.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Like you'd betray me, you'd have no one to join you in your sex
            dungeon then." I joked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "IT IS NOT A SEX DUNGEON! ...." Tisiel shouted. "I am not sure what
            it is yet, but maybe next time we go out I will bring someone else."
            She said looking away from me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ohhh, who do you have in mind? Is it Reingard?" I asked. Her face
            went bright red, I felt kind of awkward then. I had no idea she even
            felt that way about him, or anyone. After all we had really only met
            recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            "No no no .. I mean like, he's nice, but this is all besides the
            point! You are already in this deep, so you are coming next time
            even if you don't want to." She said flustered. I found the whole
            thing kind of funny, while we had just met I had to admit Tisiel was
            a much better friend then some of my friends from the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Back to the real topic. The place looked like a study when you
            really think about it, but why? Who would build a study at the back
            of the cliff side when the academy would of been closer to the
            entrance. I am sure I will get to the bottom of this though." Tisiel
            said looking down at the soft toy in her arms.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am sure you will find out. But the REAL topic is the magic items!
            Honestly if you really want any of items I would give them up to
            you. I would rather have a trust worthy partner then one or two
            magic items I am not sure I can even use." I said thinking I could
            not be sure I could even use all of these items.
          </p>
          {/* Here - Does tisiel give the items back later? */}
          <p>
            "Ohh, you trust me? That's new! I'll tell you what each item does,
            well what I know. Then we take turns picking one each? That way if
            there is an item you can use you will pick it first." Tisiel
            suggested. I guess I never did tell her I could identify some items
            but it is her hobby so..
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mmm that's fair, honestly with the exams coming up and team
            matches, I am sure I will need someone to watch my back." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>"I would not count on me in a fight." She giggled.</p>
          <p>
            She then continued pointing to the wand laying on the bed. "Starting
            with the wand and ring that opened the door. I am unsure what else
            they can do but they are the keys to opening the door and maybe a
            link to the people that made the door & graveyard. I'd like to keep
            studying them..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Taking two already? It's fine, we might need them in the future I
            won't give you a hard time you can keep them without it counting as
            one of yours." I replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel nodded and continued "Now the Kings crown. It's the Crown of
            the Dammed. A rare piece, increases your magic and decreases your
            charisma, as well as increasing the number of undead you can
            control."
          </p>
          <p>"Creepy." I said.</p>
          <p>
            "Yes well, perfect for a necromancer or a mage who just does not
            care for their appearance and others." She replied.
          </p>
          <p>"Ah, so it's perfect for you?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Tsst, I actually do want it, it is interesting but I do care how I
            look thank you very much." She retorted.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mmm sorry that was too far, I think you and Reingard will make a
            beautiful couple." I said.
          </p>
          <p>"I.. What? Why do you say that!?" She demanded.</p>
          <p>
            "Knew it. Now keep going before he gets the wrong idea about why I
            keep coming into your room alone with you." I said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Tsst, you. The kings ring, is an basic undead control ring
            increasing your control over the undead." She explained.
          </p>
          <p>"Yours." I said.</p>
          <p>
            "Thank you. The queens tiara, it's called Queen's pawn, it comes
            with the skill animate stone. That explains the thing that attacked
            us in the grave yard." She explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Her ring, it gives a little strength to the wearer." She added.
          </p>
          {/* What fucking research? Nothing about the coins? */}
          <p>
            "Finally the princesses coin, who through more research I am not sure
            if she was their daughter at all. I am not even sure if they are
            related and this coin is a mystery to me, can't find any references
            to coins like it, and I cannot tell what kind of magic it contains."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hmmm kind of junky items then? The tiara sounds expensive maybe it
            would be better to sell it?" I suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah I don't feel like you are wrong, its so niche. It's not like
            we have a stone mason to make use humanoid statue's. Anyway the
            stuff from the room. The pendent increase your magic much more then
            normal items but reduces your strength. It's really popular among
            mages if you take it with the queens ring there will be no negative
            effects, can't have you becoming to small." She said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha, I'll take them, even if you are trying to get rid of that
            ring. Your strength stat is not related to your muscle mass anyway,
            you trickster."
          </p>
          <p>"Hehe you saw through that. Next is the skull-" She started</p>
          <p>"Yours." I interrupted.</p>
          <p>"It might be amazing." She suggested.</p>
          <p>
            "... No one is going to talk to me if I walk around with a skull." I
            retorted.
          </p>
          <p>"Why do you care if people talk to you?" Tisiel asked.</p>
          <p>"Do you want the skull or not?" I replied.</p>
          <p>
            "Fine, I wanted it anyway. Now the Hat increases your magic. It's
            actually pretty good." She said.
          </p>
          <p>"And the quill?" I said pointing to it.</p>
          <p>"Come on you don't want the quill." She argued.</p>
          <p>"Yeah, I want the hat but what does the quill do?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah, it helps your chances when etching enchantments on items" She
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I get the feeling you came out of this better then me" I said
            picking up the hat.
          </p>
          <p>"There is still the coin and tiara." She pointed out.</p>
          <p>
            "I'll take the coin, you can sell the tiara and buy me dinner, I'm
            sure I was right about that sex dungeon." I said reminding her of
            our bet.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I will stab you to death with this quill if you mention that
            again." She said getting the tiara.
          </p>
          <p>"Hehe, fine let's go eat." I said.</p>
          {/* Dinner - add transition */}
          <p>
            We both headed downstairs and into the shared space to eat dinner
            with the others.
          </p>
          {/* Elaborate on the meal? */}
          <p>
            "Tisiel. It had slipped my mind, but Lubin mentioned two mages the
            Necromancer and the Deathknight in passing. I took notes on the
            these two from the main library, I think you might find them more
            useful then me, since you have necromancer items now." I said to
            Tisiel during our dinner.
          </p>
          {/* Tisiel day - element death */}
          <p>
            "Ah thank you! I will need good road map of what spells to take. I
            was worried when I picked the death element. I know it is a common
            element but not everyone gets it." She said accepting the notes I
            took.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Go ahead, but don't summon skeletons and leave them in my room." I
            joked.
          </p>
          <p>"Ah that was my whole plan!" She giggled.</p>
