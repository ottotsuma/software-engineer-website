            I woke early and ran down to the area, the training stones where not
            as busy as yesterday but I am sure they will be later. For now only
            a few students milled about. I went straight over to the combat
            stone. I ran into a problem right away, the combat stone was for
            groups. It was a way to fight against other groups practice your
            team work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mmm no worries, this might be useful in the future but right now I
            need to train myself. The only major training area left was the
            duels. This area was still busy unfortunately.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the way over I saw Vasso from the lightning class. I did not
            expect him to be up so early since he was nobility I guess I judged
            him wrong. He was surrounded by boys wanting to get close to him and
            girls even closer. When I got to the stone it was displaying both
            first and second year rankings separately like the other training
            areas. Right at the top of the first year rankings was the name
            Vasso Elzach. I guess I really miss judged him.
          </p>

          <p>
            I touched the stone and went inside. Inside the space was white, I
            could move about as normal but nothing else was around. Soon a deep
            voice came from everywhere and nowhere. "Match found." Suddenly I
            was dropped into some sand. The sun was bright to my right and
            across from me was another student. "Random arena: Desert. Match
            starts in 3." Looks like it will be different each time. "2." I
            pulled my warhammer out. "1." Cloaked myself in lightning. "Start!"
            I ran to my opponent.
          </p>

          <p>
            My speed started a little slow because of the sand, so I used
            'Charged Charge' to make up some of the distance. My opponent became
            clearer, it was hard to tell from a distance because we all have the
            same robes but it was a blonde girl. The sand whipped up and flew
            into my face, the wind slowed my progress and blinded me. The girl
            must of have the wind element I thought as the sand battered my face
            and eyes. While I was being hindered she gathered mana in her hands
            and shot a wind cutter towards me.
          </p>

          <p>
            It slammed into my arm since I could not see it coming easily, my HP
            had dropped by almost 50%. None of my new spells would help me out
            in this situation, I shot a lighting ball at her but she easily
            avoided it. When I had got closer she just ran away, using the wind
            to help slow me down. The match ended with my loss.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was not ejected like the other training areas, but given the
            choice to find a new match. I decided to try again, I guess a wind
            user a in a desert was a bad match up for me. This time I landed in
            a small pool of water, about 5cm deep. I stood up and saw it was
            nothing but really shallow water all around. My opponent was not to
            happy about it either and used his fire magic to dry himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fire and Water? I should be at an advantage here with lightning. As
            soon as the match started I used chain-lighting on the water. The
            lightning snaked over but half way across he just evaporated the
            water in that spot with a fireball. The water became steam and the
            lightning fizzed out in the air.
          </p>

          <p>
            His magic must be stronger then mine to counter it like that I
            thought. I ran though the water letting a lighting ball fly from my
            hands. He left loose a fireball at my lightning ball, mine collapsed
            on impact, but his flew past me. When I had got in close he threw up
            a wall of fire between us, I jumped into it and slammed my warhammer
            down into his arms coving his face.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am sure I did lot's of damage to him, but I took damage from the
            wall of fire, and my robe was still on fire. I used 'Charged Charge'
            into him as he point blank released another fire ball into my face.
            I won the match with almost zero health left. I was starting to
            think my strength would be useful later on, but I need to be faster
            or have higher level magic to help me close the distance, right now
            I was just being used as target practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wanted to do one more match, honestly I liked doing duels. However
            I decided against it. In the end I would not net any rewards, I was
            not good enough and the thing I wanted to do most was kill monsters.
            I had no interest in joining the army and fighting the kingdom in
            the west every 5 years, the republic in the north now the rebellion
            had started. I would much rather head back to Savigal and fight
            monsters until I am strong enough to travel out of Alden.

{/* Shrorlei,  Reingard, Tisiel, Ralsan, Leon*/}
          <p>I left and went to find Tisiel to see if she had made any progress. Walking though the smaller training areas I ran into Ralsan & Shrorlei. "Hey are you two going to train?" I asked them.</p>
