            I woke early and ran down to the area, the training stones where not
            as busy as yesterday but I am sure they will be later. For now only
            a few students milled about. I went straight over to the combat
            stone. I ran into a problem right away, the combat stone was for
            groups. It was a way to fight against other groups practice your
            team work.

            Mmm no worries, this might be useful in the future but right now I
            need to train myself. The only major training area left was the
            duels. This area was still busy unfortunately.
          </p>
          <p>On the way over I saw Vasso from the lightning class. I did not expect him to be up so early since he was nobility I guess I judged him wrong. He was surrounded by boys wanting to get close to him and girls even closer. When I got to the stone it was displaying both first and second year rankings separately like the other training areas. Right at the top of the first year rankings was the name Vasso Elzach. I guess I really miss judged him.</p>

          <p>I guy behind me saw me looking at the rankings and leaned over to talk to me. Thinking about it, no matter which training area I went to someone was always way to nosey.</p>
