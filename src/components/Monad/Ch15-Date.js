          <h4>Cafe Date - Otto</h4>
          <p>
            I arrived at the cafe before the agreed time, there were lots of
            various cafes around, small and large selling breads, cakes and
            drinks of all kinds. One cafe I walked past had little figures
            placed on a tray on the table and on request the staff would put
            them into a glass where a small liquid explosion took place and the
            glass filled up.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the back was a large cat figure, this was another cafe where the
            building itself looked like a cat, it was so obvious when placed
            next to the other buildings I could see why Tsuma had agreed to meet
            outside this cafe, that way we would not get lost. I waited there
            for awhile watching small bird creatures breath out fire to toast
            bread, a lizard creature who's tail was cut off then fed a rat which
            caused it to grow back instantly. It never flinched or seemed to be
            in pain, the tail was then placed into a metal cup with some powder
            and whisked quickly. Soon enough multi-colored strings could be seen
            wrapping around each other to make what looked like fluffy ice cream
            with a foggy layer been given off to show just how cold it was.
          </p>

          <p>
            She came walking up the street in a black dress that stopped just
            past her knees, sleeves down to a triangle over the back of her
            hand, and a webbed pattern across the top of her chest. Something
            about it seems like the fashion of an Alden witch but something was
            a little off, no hat.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hey, you look really beautiful, what happened to your other dress?
            Was I suppose to change also?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, I had to change! That dress did not suit the place I wanted to
            go. You look good no need to change honestly."
          </p>

          <p>"Thank you. So where is it you had in mind?"</p>

          <p>
            "Here of course!" She said pointing to the large cat shaped
            building.
          </p>

          <p>
            I stared at the building again, a light brown and white cat with its
            eyes closed in a kind of smile laying down with its tail wrapped
            around itself. The door was in the side of the cat. "I... Was not
            expecting that."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, I love cats and I always wanted to try this place. You don't
            mind do you?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "No it's fine, let's go." I took her by the hand and headed to the
            door to the cat shaped cafe. I did not notice the other girl
            following us with her hood up over her head to cover her face.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the cat shaped cafe was full of cats. The cat shaped cafe was
            in fact a cat cafe. I don't know why I was so surprised. Maybe
            because the other cafes today where all so exotic to me that I did
            not expect a cafe just full of cats.
          </p>

          <p>
            We where sat near one of the walls with cats sleeping all over the
            place, every time you tried to get near one to pet it it would
            either not move and not care or run away at top speed. It seemed
            that throughout the day the cats have had enough customers come to
            play with them. While we sat there we drank a hot drink from the
            kingdom. It tastes of ginger, warmth and sweet flowers. I wish I
            knew how to make it, this would be the perfect companion at night
            when out traveling.
          </p>

          <p>
            A sudden flash of light appeared in the corner of my eye,
            "MEEEOWWWW." A black cat with bright purple eyes was on the desk as
            Tsuma was stoking it's head. "This is Byakko, he's my cat. I thought
            since non of the others want to play with us they might play with
            him."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Greetings to THE Otto I am Byakko." The cat spoke with an old deep
            voice that very much did not suit it's extremely cute face. Byakko
            bowed his head during his greeting and then face up to me looking me
            dead in the eye awaiting a response.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taken back a little, I stammered out "HE-llo I am named Otto, what
            do you mean by THE Otto?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh his Alden is a little rusty we only speak Leikan at home.. Off
            you go play!" She made a shooing motion with her hands as Byakko
            looked a little displeased muttering to himself "My Alden is just
            fine I can speak over 20 languages fluently..." He jumped onto the
            floor landing on his front paws and walking off proudly, head in the
            air and tail swishing back and forth.
          </p>

          <p>
            "So erm, why Alden? I mean there are magic academy's in most of the
            realms, why do people from all over come to Alden? Why did you
            come?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "That's easy, I came to try a new culture and because I really want
            to learn Alden magic! I read about it when I was a child and always
            wanted to try the magics that can be found here. As for others, I am
            not sure why they come but people go to magic academy's all over."
          </p>

          <p>
            "I didn't know Alden had magic you can't learn else where. Makes
            sense that people travel all over if that is the case."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh it is not like the magic is locked in one place, it is more like
            the expert in that magic taught there, the resources needed are
            there, things like that. Lakia's academy is famous for summoning,
            speech, illusion and demon magic. Alden is famous for witch, charms
            and hex magic."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah that makes sense. I got to ask though.. What is demon magic?" I
            asked curious.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah not as bad as it sounds, I guess demon is the wrong word. It is
            not like the demons that fight against the God of light here in
            Alden but more like.. Hmmm the name we give to the creatures you can
            summon. The magic they can use we try to learn it."
          </p>

          <p>"Oh sorry. I didn't mean to accuse you of anything bad."</p>

          <p>"No it is fine, just a misunderstanding, my bad translation."</p>

          <p>
            "No way, your Aldenese is perfect. So where would you like to go
            next?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I'm sorry but since it is late I will have to go back home. I did
            not tell the others I was coming out so they will worry..."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh, no no I am sorry I forgot it was super late. I'll walk you
            home, I have to walk past the Leikan camp to get back to the cliff
            side."
          </p>

          <p>
            "The cliff side!? I did not know that place was for students. It
            looks so.."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, yeah from the outside it looks really bad, it's fine inside
            though. We have normal rooms."
          </p>

          <p>
            I tried to laugh off the awkward situation, I forgot the reputation
            the cliff side might have. I hope she does not mind that I was placed
            there. I guess it just shows that I am not from a wealthy
            background...
          </p>

          <p>
            We walked back home, chatting about the academy and what kind of
            magic she was hoping to learn about here. I found out it is possible
            to learn a new element or magic type though practice, but unless you
            reach a high level, Like a really high level, it would only be
            possible to use if you replaced your own and reset back to level 1.
            She told me she was aiming to reach that high level where it is
            possible to use two types of magic at the same time. I was super
            impressed by her ambition.
          </p>

          <p>We parted ways outside the Leikan camp and I headed back to the cliff side for the night.</p>
