            The next day I walked into the usual morning class room to be
            greeted by the most unwelcome faces I have met in my short stay on
            this planet. Both the boys and the girls looked at me like I was
            some kind of traitor. The last time I saw them all it was they that
            betrayed me. They had planned to attack me while the teacher was not
            looking and not stop until I was badly hurt or dead all I did was
            defend myself. It might not of been all of them but they seemed
            guilty by association in my mind.
