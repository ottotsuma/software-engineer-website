          <h3>Back to school</h3>
          <p>
            The next day I walked into the usual morning class room to be
            greeted by the most unwelcome faces I have met in my short stay on
            this planet. Both the boys and the girls looked at me like I was
            some kind of traitor. The last time I saw them all it was they that
            betrayed me. They had planned to attack me while the teacher was not
            looking and not stop until I was badly hurt or dead all I did was
            defend myself. It might not of been all of them but they seemed
            guilty by association in my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weird thing was no one really said anything, the class room was
            silent. I walked to an empty area at one of the desks at the front
            and sat down. The students closest to me moved away as much as they
            could. So petty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lubin walked into the class a little late as always and the class
            regained some of it's normal life. "Nice to see you joining us again
            Otto." Lubin remarked. "As you all know today is the date to vote on
            the class champion for the battle royal coming up. The event I have
            explained in depth last week. Otto you missed that part but I am
            told you are up to speed right?" Lubin added at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah the Lakian's were kind enough to explain the details to me." I
            replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good, right then. Everyone can cast their vote by simple mana
            transfer. If you cannot interact with the academy system after all
            of that practice last week you do not get to vote. Ah Otto, you were
            not here. Erm. Give it a go anyway." He added on the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class sniggered at my predicament. They closed their eyes and
            everyone seem to go into a kind of trans. Unmoving and just their
            eye lids flickering. Lubin nudged me. "Just reach out with your
            mana, the school is trying a new method to connect an academy wide
            system to every student by letting them access it though their mana.
            There have been a lot of problems so if you cannot connect don't
            worry about it."
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat and closed my eyes like the others and reached out with my
            mana trying to move my mind around the room. Eventually I bumped
            into others until I found what they were all reaching out to, a
            thread of mana coming from somewhere inside the academy. I latched
            onto it. They must put these in every class room, my sense stat is
            rock bottom so the other students must be also.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could see though the mana, windows of writing. Forum, Shops,
            Voting and Reports. It seemed simple enough, like the academy was
            trying to modernize and make everything more efficient though the
            use of mana, it was really intuitive, they must of spent a lot of
            time creating this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I moved into voting and saw classes by their numbers. I quickly
            found my class and inside was a list of all the students names. I
            voted on a student at random, honestly I did not care who it was as
            long as it was not me.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Everyone has finished voting, so let me total up the votes and make
            sure the system worked fine. If it breaks again we will just vote by
            hands." Lubin said closing his eyes for a moment. "So...." Lubing
            seemed unusually awkward. "Runner up is Max. Max you will be
            participating in the event the forerunner is unable to attend."
            Lubin announced.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What!? Who the hell voted for me? I'll break your legs right here
            and now!" Max declared standing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You'll do no such thing." Lubin replied. "Our champion for the
            upcoming event is .... Otto." Lubin placed his hands down by his
            side.
          </p>
          <div className="BreakPoint"></div>
          <p>
            After class Lubin kept me behind saying he was going to explain what
            was to happen. Since I was elected class champion it came as no
            surprise to anyone else. "You can quit combat still, that will count
            as a forfeit and Max will have to take your place. I would not
            normally say this but clearly you were not picked with good
            intentions. You or Max. Honestly I want to demand another way to do
            this but the academy right now is a bit of a mess." Lubin said in a
            frustrated voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The duels from before. What was the point if they do not decide the
            class champion?" I asked thinking back to that pointless exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It was just a practice. Normally around now we hold duels and
            contests for the students to see what their talents are and what
            grades to give them. This happens again at the end of the year.
            However this year things have changed and there will be no
            graduation battles as normal." Lubin said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You do not have to dance around the subject so much. I know we are
            going to war against the Republic." I replied. "Can I give you my
            reply tomorrow?" I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            "How...Yeah sure. Let me know tomorrow what you want to do." Lubin
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            I left the class and went to the library. The halls were packed with
            students talking about who became class champion for their class and
            what was going on. After all some students had older siblings or
            parents that told them about the academy and knew this was not the
            normal process. I wanted to get back to Takeo & Tsuma and let them
            know what was going on and ask for their opinions. However I also
            had to look for any information about KÊ¼awiil, the serpent people
            and the kingdoms myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            The library was the main library for the academy. The students had
            libraries near or around their living quarters that contained the
            most common and used school books. This meant that the main library
            was kept less busy then it would otherwise be. The man behind the
            desk saw me coming in, since first years had received their official
            uniforms it would be impossible to tell a first year from a second
            year however when I arrived at the desk the first thing the man said
            to me was "The students library's contain all of the books students
            need for their first year here. This library only contains only
            history books and various niche studies not covered in the first
            year, or most second year studies."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Erm, thank you but I am looking for books on the history of the
            kingdom, serpent people, their mythologies & gods. Is this the right
            place for that?" I asked.
          </p>
          {/* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshoni_language */}
          <p>
            "Serpent people? Do you mean the Shoshoni? Serpent people is maybe a
            way you should not describe them out loud." He said pushing his
            glasses up his nose. "We have books on the history of the kingdom
            but the mythologies & Gods of the Shoshoni... I will take a look
            while you see if you can find what you are looking for in the
            kingdoms section." With that he took me to where the books related
            to the kingdom were kept. It was somehow both larger and smaller
            then what I imagined. Maybe the academy should have lots of books
            about the kingdom or barely any I thought but it seemed somewhere in
            the middle of my imagination. I started by picking out books that
            might have really old history of the Kingdom or that area of land
            before It was called the Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned a lot about the kingdom and the Shoshoni people. The
            kingdom had many people groups and races along with that came many
            religions and cultures. In the town of Metium, a small town of the
            coast of the kingdom on an island all to itself was the last place
            where the Old Elladan Pantheon was still the majority religion. The
            majority of the south of the kingdom had converted to the new
            Elladan Church. The major difference being that in the Elladan
            Church there was only one God. 'Kyra Ampi, The Amber Creator' was
            the major god of the Old Elladan Pantheon, and had many similarities
            with the one God of the new Elladan Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other majority religion in the area was called 'Ehtenfeld
            Beliefs'. Although it was hard to call this a religion but just what
            the majority of nomadic people and northern tribes came under. It
            was the group for anyone who believed there were no Gods just
            powerful monsters or people. It was named after Ehtenfeld but if
            this was a place or a persons name that was unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Old Elladan Pantheon was recorded as one of the major
            religions of the Kingdom that was more because of it's historical
            value then the number of people who still practiced it. It seemed
            that it stretched back to before the conquest of the Pocotocotcan.
            This meant that the religion could of undertaken some major changes
            during that period of subjugation, and the religion as it is now
            might not have kept all of the same Gods.
          </p>

          <p>
            What surprised me the most was one of the Gods in the Old Elladan
            Pantheon was 'EkÊ¼ Chuah' Although the . A name I had not seen since
            he left me in the tomb. The god of Cacao a plant from the jungles of
            Pocotocotcan, he was a merchant God, not the God of death as he
            described himself when we spoke. While any reference to KÊ¼awiil
            could not be found. What was more curious was that none of the Gods
            had specific elements associated with them like modern Pantheons,
            they had instead characteristics or job roles. The whole thing was
            very foreign and confusing on first glance. Since non of them had
            elements attached to them I could not even find out if they had a
            lighting God and try and match any characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            There where many jobs, 'Yum Kaax' was the God of plants animals and
            hunting which farmers worshiped also. However there was no farming
            God. There was Gods for almost all jobs that could of been at that
            time, but no farming God.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was one God that caught my interest for awhile. 'Kukulkan' the
            feathered serpent God. The more I thought about the similarities
            between these Gods and the Pocotocotcans bird people, the more I
            found them to be the same. It was like when the Pocotocotcans took
            over the land which became the kingdom they forced their Gods onto
            the native people.
          </p>
          <p>
            To check if was right I found some books on Pocotocotcan religion.
            Sure enough even the names of the Gods were the same. My theory was
            holding weight, even if I was wrong I could be sure that the Gods of
            the Old Elladan Pantheon were not these Gods they had been replaced.
            The trouble was then, who were the Gods before the Pocotocotcans? Do
            they relate to KÊ¼awiil or was he another Pocotocotcan God?
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah if only Tisiel was still here, she would be able to solve some of
            these problems or at least have the patience to find the answer in
            these books. Whatever, if I could not find the answer easily I could
            not spend all week in here looking for answers. I was elected the
            class champion as a sacrifice, either I train to the point I feel I
            can beat all the other elected in a fight or drop out of combat
            classes.
          </p>
          {/* EkÊ¼ Chuah  / KÊ¼awiil*/}
          <p>
            I left the library a little frustrated. I had not really found
            anything directly useful about the class I currently had. The
            library had taken me close to the main building in the academy. On
            the way back I walked past the doors to the main hall and the group
            of trees outside I met Tsuma under before we went to the cat cafe.
          </p>
{/* Insert story here */}
          <p>
            I went to see Tisiel and Takeo. They where the only people I really
            trusted right now and I valued their opinions over that of anyone
            else in the academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went over to the training hall next to the princesses quatres.
            Sure enough Takeo was inside training by himself. "Hey, do you know
            where Tsuma is? I got elected as class representative..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Takeo stopped and turned to me. "She had to go with the princess
            today. They are out hunting with that lighting boy. Elzach? Well
            even if you are elected just gives you more reason to level up.
            Let's head out." He said.
          </p>
          <p>"Right now? I just got back.." I replied.</p>
