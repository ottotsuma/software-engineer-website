          <h3>Back to school</h3>
          <p>
            The next day I walked into the usual morning class room to be
            greeted by the most unwelcome faces I have met in my short stay on
            this planet. Both the boys and the girls looked at me like I was
            some kind of traitor. The last time I saw them all it was they that
            betrayed me. They had planned to attack me while the teacher was not
            looking and not stop until I was badly hurt or dead all I did was
            defend myself. It might not of been all of them but they seemed
            guilty by association in my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weird thing was no one really said anything, the class room was
            silent. I walked to an empty area at one of the desks at the front
            and sat down. The students closest to me moved away as much as they
            could. So petty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lubin walked into the class a little late as always and the class
            regained some of it's normal life. "Nice to see you joining us again
            Otto." Lubin remarked. "As you all know today is the date to vote on
            the class champion for the battle royal coming up. The event I have
            explained in depth last week. Otto you missed that part but I am
            told you are up to speed right?" Lubin added at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah the Lakian's were kind enough to explain the details to me." I
            replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good, right then. Everyone can cast their vote by simple mana
            transfer. If you cannot interact with the academy system after all
            of that practice last week you do not get to vote. Ah Otto, you were
            not here. Erm. Give it a go anyway." He added on the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class sniggered at my predicament. They closed their eyes and
            everyone seem to go into a kind of trans. Unmoving and just their
            eye lids flickering. Lubin nudged me. "Just reach out with your
            mana, the school is trying a new method to connect an academy wide
            system to every student by letting them access it though their mana.
            There have been a lot of problems so if you cannot connect don't
            worry about it."
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat and closed my eyes like the others and reached out with my
            mana trying to move my mind around the room. Eventually I bumped
            into others until I found what they were all reaching out to, a
            thread of mana coming from somewhere inside the academy. I latched
            onto it. They must put these in every class room, my sense stat is
            rock bottom so the other students must be also.
          </p>
          <p>I could see though the mana, windows of writing. Forum, Shops, Voting and Reports. It seemed simple enough, like the academy was trying to modernize and make everything more efficient though the use of mana, it was really intuitive, they must of spent a lot of time creating this.</p>
          <p>I moved into voting and saw classes by their numbers. </p>
