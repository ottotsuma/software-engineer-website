          <h3>City of Banderedam</h3>
          <p>
            Arriving before the city of Banderedam, trails of students heading
            to the academy could be seen next to the city. The city itself was
            across a small stone bridge across the river Chitna, which ended
            just short of the city gate house, a wooden drawbridge made up for
            gap. There where square shaped towers all around the walls spaced
            apart, a wooden roof built atop. The gate house must of been rebuilt
            because the towers were built with a new circular design and stone
            roofs. There was a walled and roofed walkway between the two towers
            visible from the outside, as it ran over the gate house giving the
            defenders room to drop things onto attacks. Even the older towers
            and walls had matriculations.

            After getting out of the boat at the temporary station set up to
            deal with the large influx of people we made our way to the town by
            foot.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once at the gate, guards where outside checking people coming into
            the city. With my ID card, letters of introduction to the magic
            academy and my age it was easy for me to pass though the gate. Leon
            lived there so he was able to pass though easily. Meeting up again
            inside Leon took me to the shopping district so he could drop off
            his package and I could go shopping for a wand.
          </p>

          <p>
            The town inside was packed, the buildings clearly had been built
            with space between them to avoid fires but smaller temporary
            structures, carts and peddlers had set up in those spaces selling
            and buying goods coming and going from the ports of Tirnadepal and
            Tirnavalli. There were of course also goods being sold especially
            this time of year for new and old students entering the academy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leon had taken me to a wand shop that had been there since before
            Banderedam was apart of Alden. Inside was clean, really clean. Not a
            single spec of dust was anywhere to be found, the wands were
            displayed around the shop in glass cases and up on the walls in
            glass cases. Each wand had a card next to it with its description
            and price.

Charlemagne in 794 decreed that a single silver penny (weighing 1.7 grams) should buy a dozen two-pound loaves of wheat bread.

            To put it bluntly, it was hard to miss. That wand stood out from the
            others, and not in a way that made him want to buy it. While
            thinking what kind of mad man would make such a thing let alone sell
            it his thoughts where interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>"First time? I wouldn't recommend that particular one"</p>
          <p>
            "Uh yeah, it's my first time here. I won't be getting that one, what
            even is it?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, not all items are made, some are dropped by monsters so it's
            hard to say. Let me help you out, this is my shop, I can do at least
            that much. Names Pal" He said his hand stretched out.
          </p>
          {/* <!-- pall means Tiny, petite --> */}
          <p>
            True to his name he was a small man no more then 150cm, I reached
            out and shook his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So first tell me, do you know what field you would like to go
            into?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am not too sure myself, I think I want the lightning element.
            Sorry I am not sure."
          </p>
          <p>"A mage who apiologies, rare."</p>
          <p>
            "Are other mages rude? Is it only those with bad parents who become
            mages?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ahaha, might be so, we just say it is because they think they are
            gifted more then others. Makes them arrogant, being locked away most
            of the year in that academy doesn’t help. But don't speak like that
            around other mages, you won't make friends that way ahaha."
          </p>
          <p>
            The shop keeper layed out 3 wands before me. "Nothing quite as fancy
            as some of the other wands, but at least useable by a beginner. Now
            I should explain the stats displayed are reflective of my
            measurements, that is to say the exact effect it will have on will
            be reflective of your own level. Maybe a point lower, nothing more."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah yeah, my dad was an item inspector also. How much are they?" I asked
          </p>
          <p>"Same price, ¤100,000." He replied.</p>
          <p>"Less then I thought, more then I have." I admitted</p>
          <p>
            "Only students from nobel houses pay with cash anyway, if you sign
            for something I can collect it later at the academy and they take it
            from your mission rewards, until they are paid back. Don't go crazy
            though they won't loan a first year more then ¤100,000." He
            explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good thing the prices match then." I said with my eye brow arched.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Don't look at me like that, I already discounted them so you could
            afford it if you like them. I won't force you, no doubt you will be
            coming back for many years." He replied with his smile back on his
            face.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ah, thank you" I bowed deeply. "Could I buy the detect magic wand?"
            I asked.
          </p>
          <p>"Feeling you might get lucky on a mission?" He questioned.</p>
          <p>
            "The opposite, feel like I will be unlucky and not spot something."
            I laughed.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's yours, if I where you I'd keep it to yourself. Although it
            gives you access to the skill, still costs mana, you have to push
            your mana into the wand, though it and out the other side. Normally
            I ask people not to test wands in here but in this case it won't do
            any harm so give it ago." He said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If you are sure." I pushed my mana into the wand, it flowed though
            like my arm is longer then normal feeling apart of myself as far as
            the mana is concerned and out the other side where upon my eye sight
            is filled in color. Almost all objects in the shop glow different
            strange colours.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Quite the show isn't it? Almost every item in here contains magic
            so, thats why." He said looking at my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>"Why are there so many colours?" I asked.</p>
          <p>
            "Different types of magic, like the manastone when you touch it
            turns purple-ish right?" He said.
          </p>
          <p>"Yeah" I replied.</p>
          <p>
            "Well" taking a mana stone out from his desk and leaving it in the
            palm of his hand, the stone turns from its usual sea blue to dark
            forest green. "Wood is my element."
          </p>
          <p>
            I nodded in understanding. After thanking the shop keeper again I
            left the shop with my new wand hidden away, heading to meet Leon at
            'Főzelékfaló' a small cafe in the castle area. I ordered Főzelék as
            Leon had recommended it. An interesting experience, tasted like
            thick vegetable stew although that description does it little
            justice.

          </div>

          <p>"Good isn't it?" Leon's voice came from behind me.</p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, I don't really know how to describe it, can you make it?" I
            replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yeah I can, but not as well. If you want to learn my sister will be
            able to show you, I am sure you will get time to come visit us the
            minimum stay in the academy is 2 years after all."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I will, it's not like there are other towns near the academy, so I
            guess I will be coming often."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Aha you're welcome to, but you studies might be a little more
            intense then you think."
          </p>

          <p>
            After thanking Leon for showing me where to get a good meal, and
            introducing me to a reliable shop keeper. my journey to the Academy
            was only a few short hours walk from Banderedam, although the other
            students often chose to spend their money on rented mounts, I could
            not ride, and was bankrupt.
