          <p>
            I had put a point into magic already, and acquired one spell from
            the new class. It felt wrong, like the display was for someone elses
            and mine would come back any moment. I want to believe it was
            because the lightning damaged it in some way. Seeing that faith had
            N/A next to it though, it must of had something to do with the worst
            God ever.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hope the other don't notice that strong wind would break me right
            about now, I need to get out of here really, but even if I leave
            alone I won't make it back in this condition.
          </p>

          <p>
            We had opted to walk straight back and try and locate if there was a
            library according to the layout of previous tombs Vortigern had
            studied. We stopped and slept when we could in turns and just all
            rested awake other times. It was hard to keep track of how much time
            had really passed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually we came to a place Vortigern was sure should be the
            location of the library in other tombs. Again with large double
            doors that he opened in his own language. Inside however, did not
            look like a library. The place was a mess unlike the armory, burn
            marks, holes in walls and nothing but ash and oversized bones
            scatted about the place.
          </p>

          <p>
            "How is this place such a huge mess, but the armory was left almost
            spotless. There was not even any dust inside there!" Tisiel demanded
            to know.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Are you asking me? I've been very clear and upfront that I have
            never been down here before. I only know a rough way around because
            the layouts of these tombs cannot vary too much since they are built
            within a body, and I have studied the anatomy of immortals."
            Vortigern replied.
          </p>

          <p>"Hmph! So this was a waste..." Tisiel let out a long sigh.</p>

          {/* <p>I am so tired, not sleepy but tired. Maybe we should of been working on leaving but I guess greed got a dark grip around my heart. We walked around the library for a little while before deciding on leaving.</p> */}

          <p>
            Me and Reingard decided to look around the library for awhile,
            Tisiel waited by the entrance. She claimed just encase but clearly
            she was very frustrated, we had been down here for days, tired and
            her skills did not work right away. Still I was still over the moon
            about the set that I got.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard soon gave up his light search of kick over near by objects
            and checking what was nearby and headed over to Tisiel. I decided it
            would be nice if they had some alone time so I took Vortigern with
            me to look down the other tunnel we passed by on the way here.
          </p>

          <p>
            "So, question i've had on my mind for a long time. We found you in
            some kind of study right? What was that place?" I asked to pass the
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah, did you learn the story witch of Alden? It was a story Tisiel
            taught me, well long story short it was her study after she
            discovered the gate way to this land, the portal you came though
            near Brandenburg." Vortigern replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Did not see that coming you where with the Witch... Tisiel was
            saying something before about all of the locations having something
            to do with death? Did she die there?" I carried on the conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah no no no, it was just her study, she found the coin in a tomb
            along with myself and she spent some time studying this land and
            history before leaving and well I guess the story is about what she
            did after she left me behind in that study."
          </p>

          <p>
            "So left me run this by you again, the Immortals made this tomb,
            sealed it with coins and then they where passed down though the eras
            until being left behind in tombs and forgotten?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "Are you just making small talk? Yes we often sealed things with
            coins, they are easily stored and you can decorate them. Whats wrong
            with that? Well it is not like I was allowed access to everything in
            every era but they mostly used this place to store things and the
            coins where kept by the people in charge of protecting them. I guess
            when their era's end and there was no one to pass the coins onto it
            just kind of stayed with them. "
          </p>

          <p>
            After that I stopped trying to make small talk, I guess I am not
            very good at making small talk since he called me out on it. For a
            person who has livid longer then everyone else I guess he is bored
            of small talk.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of the tunnel was a single stone coffin. Nothing else was
            around and the only light source I had was a mana-ball Reingard
            stuck to me after I told him I was low on mana. I don't have that
            spell anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            I looked around although I am not too sure why. I grabbed aside of
            the stone lid and before I could push I was interrupted.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What are you doing? That is clearly a coffin. You know where dead
            people are kept." Vortigern said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yeah, he's dead, but what if he has something useful in there to
            keep me alive?" I replied and tried to push the lid off then
            remembered that I currently have no strength at all. I let out a
            sigh remembering what happened.
          </p>
          {/* Pre-Dao, Dao-era, Immortal-era, ****, ****, ****, Pyramid, Witch, Now. */}
          <p>
            I walked back to the ground I left Vortigern on near by when
            suddenly the stone lid of the coffin shot off and flew off down the
            tunnel with a bang. A skeleton rose up from the coffin.
          </p>

          <p>
            I turned around ready to run, that scared the hell out of me and I
            no way I could fight this giant skeleton! However it did not move.
          </p>

          <p>
            "AHAHAHAHAHAHA" Vortigern actually burst out laughing. "Oh wow I
            have not seen that one in years! Your face! Oh wow."
          </p>

          <p>"What? What is this?" I yelled</p>
          <p>
            "Ah it is a classic joke my people pulled on each other. It is a
            coffin set up with spring magic I guess you could say. It is a prank
            to scare people. I haven't seen it since I first joined my sect all
            those years ago." Vortigern kept laughing like this was the funniest
            thing in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Your people where weird? You know that?" I walked off holding the
            laughing skull back to Tisiel. I did not have the heart to even look
            in the coffin anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            I threw the laughing skull back to Tisiel. "Please never leave me
            alone with him again, I am convinced he knew what was going to
            happen."
          </p>

          <p>"Huh? What happened? You look like a ghost." Tisiel asked.</p>
          <p>
            I just shock my head. "Let's get out of here." I walked off down the
            tunnel and they soon followed after. We traveled for only a few
            hours before coming across a sight we did not think we would find.
          </p>

          <p>
            We found blood all over the walls, the floor. Pieces of arm and legs
            organs, the size made it clear that it was a human and a fresh one.
          </p>

          <p>
            I moved slightly closer to the mess, Reingard walked up ahead and
            picked up something from one of the pieces. "It's Nymandus." he
            said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "How did he even end up here, let alone die. His element was strong
            against the undead." Tisiel pointed out.
          </p>

          <p>"Are we pushing forward?" I asked.</p>

          <p>
            "Are you mad? Turn and run already. He was far stronger then any of
            you." Vortigern replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            I turned to run, but then I saw behind Tisiel, a mixture of shadow
            and bone. I am not sure what it once was with three arms, some rib
            bones but nothing below and no face. The shadows moved and filled in
            the rest, falling over each other to hold it up. String of what was
            cloth hanging between the bones at peeps between the folding
            shadows.
          </p>

          <p>
            No one needed to tell me to run this time. Although the only
            direction was in which lay Nymandus dead body the other would soon
            be my resting place if I went that way. Reingard ran past me to grab
            Tisiel as she sprinted towards me leading the way down the tunnel.
            We did not get too far before another fork in the tunnels, I took
            the left one without hesitation and as soon as I had run though the
            bones on the ground I missed rose up. With the strange shadows
            grabbing at them pulling them into shape.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel and Reingard ran right away from the forming skeletons and
            down that tunnel. Where we just tricked by undead? I didn't know
            they could be intelligent on their own.
          </p>

          <p>
            F... That is the grade I would give myself for this pigs dinner. I
            kept running. What else could I do? I was not going to turn and
            fight. I shot though the tunnels as fast as I could. The tunnel I
            took had a slight up slope to it, if this really was inside the
            skull of a dead immortal I could only guess that going up would only
            lead me into his skull. A dead end. Maybe Tisiel and Reingard where
            going in the direction of the exit.
          </p>

          <p>
            I couldn't keep running like this, I was going to collapse any
            moment. As soon as I slowed down one of the three skeletons I could
            see shot a bone from his hand like a spear and it went though my
            right leg. It did not slow down at all and pierced all the way
            though the other-side and stuck into the ground.
          </p>

          <p>
            I screamed loud and fell to my side. In a panic I shot out the only
            spell I had 'Lightning seeds'. In the past this was a faith spell I
            had been given to use once a day. Now that my class had been changed
            to Kʼawiil it seemed this was his spell and I was able to learn it
            like a normal spell.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Lightning seeds - Shoots a group of '1' seeds in a spread from the
            user. The seeds attach to opponent(s) and cause lightning damage
            over time. A part of the damage is used to restore your as mana.'
            The description was very different then when it was given to me as a
            faith spell, I guess it was because it was not his spell to give but
            whoever Kʼawiil was.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 'seeds' was just one seed, I think because it was the level 1
            version of the spell. The ball of cackling lighting in the form of a
            seed stuck into the closest one. Since it was mostly made of shadows
            it stuck into the shadow and started to cause damage and sap mana
            from it into me. The damage must of been easily shrugged off but the
            skeleton seemed to have a bad reaction to it and stopped trying to
            grab at it inside of its own shadows making up its body.
          </p>

          <p>
            My mana recovered after one moment, the damage might of been small
            but so was my amount of mana. It seemed like because they where made
            of these shadows nad just using the skeletons as armor my seed was
            having a strange reaction causing my mana to shoot up.
          </p>

          <p>
            I shot another seed at the next one, then the final skelton. While
            my mana was almost drained from each shot it quickly recovered, the
            cool down for the spell should of taken me longer to cast then this.
            Something was unusual about this place but as long as I could stay
            alive I won't question it. I reached into my inventory and grabbed
            at some healing potions and started to pour them directly onto my
            leg and drink them. I got up soon after and limped away while the
            skeletons where busy grabbing at themselves but failing because the
            seed was moving with the follow of the shadows.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hobbled off into the darkness, the light on Reingard manaball had
            gone, maybe I was too far away from them now. I felt my way along
            the wall, the grinding screams coming from behind me. I felt my way
            along the cave wall the bumps with my hands cutting my fingers but I
            had to keep going and then I felt smooth wood. It was a door,
            although I am not sure what kind as it was completely dark.
          </p>

          <p>
            I tried grabbing for a door handle or someway to open it, I pushed
            into it but nothing, so I felt around the door for anything. Maybe
            it was not a door. Then I noticed it had gone quiet again. The
            skeletons where not playing around with the seeds any more, the
            effect had worn off, why was it so fast!?
          </p>

          <p>
            I reached around and found a small bump in the wood, it was metal
            and smooth. It felt curved over like the back end of a pin inside
            the wood, I couldn't grip at it with my fingers the nails kept
            slipping. They where getting closer, I could hear their bones
            clattering against each other as the shadows shambled their way to
            me. I gripped at it and pulled but my fingers slipped again, this
            can't be the right way. I hope it's a door. The skeletons where
            close, I could hear them speed up. I punched the damn thing out of
            frustration and it moved into the wood a little. Great, now I won't
            get that out.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to try and grab at it again, but my hand met the air instead
            of wood and I felt face forward. It had opened somehow? I scrabbled
            to stand up as they had made it close enough that I could hear them
            right next to to me. I swung my body and tried to slam the door
            shut, but it hit into one of the skeletons so I slammed it again.
            And again. And again. Click. The door fell into place. I felt a warm
            liquid fall down my face.
          </p>

          <p>
            With all of my adrenaline up I did not notice that he had scratched
            across my head, and it was bleeding fast. I slumped to the ground as
            the sound of the wood being scratched and hit on the otherwise. I
            had to use more health potions already, my HP was in danger. I took
            a quick look at the system and saw that I was down to 12% hp left.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the healing potions started to take affect again, I shuffled my
            way though the darkness, there was a small light at the end of the
            darkness that lit up a small patch on the floor. I made it over to
            the light without issue, there didn't appear to be anything in here.
            I looked out and well it was not an exit. The hole was rectangle and
            cute smoothly. Beyond it was the view of a small bridge with fires
            burning around it, the bridge passed over a fissure in the ground
            which was deep enough for only darkness to be visible below it. The
            bridge however was broken, the gap between was as large as a small
            house and only the ends of each side of the bridge jutted out.
          </p>

          <p>
            The sight was an odd one, I guess someone wanted to overlook who
            crossed the bridge but it was so high up even if I jumped out I
            would die from the fall. If I missed the land and fell into the
            fissure below I would need to take a break from my screaming before
            I hit the bottom.
          </p>

          <p>
            The one thing I did not think I would need would be a light source
            but here I was sat in the dark. I took out pieces of flint wrapped
            in cloth from my back on my waist. Luckily I was not a fire-mage
            before this and would still need to create fire like everyone else.
            I am sure it might of been possible with lightning but I did not
            have that level of control. My inventory was 140 items before, room
            enough for countless pieces of junk but now I could only access 10
            slots. Luckily I filled the health potions and other important
            things in first but that left the random warm clothes and things I
            could set fire to out of reach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon the cloth caught fire and I held it up with the remains of my
            warhammer. Inside was a desk to one side, the size was far more
            human then immortal. The walls where coated with the wood and there
            where carvings of birds everywhere. Some even had a human body with
            bird wings coming from the back or under the arms. The door I came
            though was a darker wood, almost black in color.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was another door in the room thankfully, this place must of
            been some kind of study or watch room for people passing over the
            bridge below? I took one last look out of the window. It seemed that
            was the path Tisiel and Reingard took as they where stood on the
            bridge now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard had walked up to the edge of the bridge and looked around
            Tisiel seemed to be watching from behind and talking to Vortigern.
            Just as I was about to shout, Tisiel turned and ran into Reingard
            with her arms out pushing him from behind as he fell into the
            fissure below.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reingard's body, with all of his bags still on him fell into the
            darkness. I saw the skeleton from before move down towards Tisiel on
            the bridge. I was not sure if I wanted to shout out now, I was
            unable to save her and she had just killed Reingard.
          </p>

          <p>
            At that moment she disappeared from my vision and reappeared on the
            other side of the bridge. It was then I noticed that on that side
            stood 3 skeletons. These where true skeletons, there was no shadow
            holing them up inside but they where the size of immortals. Was it
            possible Vortigern had tricked them? They did not attack Tisiel
            however but seemed to greet her, she walked in between them and they
            all turned and walked off together.
          </p>

          <p>
            What could I do? I just stood staring at the scene playing before me
            like some kind of silent twisted nightmare. I couldn't understand at
            all Tisiel loved Reingard, did she push him thinking they had no
            chance to live and didn't want him to be taken? Did Vortigern trick
            them? Did she do it on purpose? How did she get over the bridge?
          </p>

          <p>
            Ah! I jumped up and stormed for the door hoping my luck would change
            as the only way it could get worse was if I was stuck in here. I
            pushed in the same metal button as before and it slid inside and
            popped out as the door swung open after a few moments. Inside was a
            spiraled stair case leading up. Hopefully out.
          </p>

          <p>
            The stair case lead me to another door made of the same color of
            wood with the same design. It was strong enough to keep those
            monsters out so I had no chance to break though it, really lucky the
            mechanisms still worked. I opened the door and it swung inwards as a
            man wearing a white and red monkey mask fell down at my feet.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was wearing odd clothes, kind of cloth that folded over his chest
            in serval layers and baggy trousers. His shoes where made of plants
            woven into each other, in all he looked like a Leikan. "You
            alright?" I asked a little startled that there was even anyone here.
          </p>

          <p>
            He looked up at me. Then quickly got to his feet. "Am I alright?
            Yeah. Why do you speak Alden? How did you get inside of the
            netherwood door? Are you a priest of the dead?" He said looked at my
            outfit and reaching for a sword by his waist.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What? I am a student at Brandenburg Magic Academy! I just came out
            of a tomb I discovered by chance, there is no need to attack me. The
            outfit is just something I found down there, it is not my normal
            clothes but they got damage in an accident..." I trailed off at the
            end not wanting to say anymore about it.
          </p>

          <p>
            "A student at... Otto? It's you!" He let his hand drop and put a
            smile on his face.
          </p>

          <p>"Yeah, I. How do you know me?" I asked more guarded now.</p>

          <p>
            "Ah I saw you in Lakia town in the academy in the past. I even sat
            next to you once when you where eating there. My names Takeo. Quick
            get out of the netherwood, it is only used in places of strong death
            to hold back the creation of undead. The wood absorbs the death
            mana." He said while pulling on my arm to take me with him outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Honestly I am just kind of glad to be out of the tomb. How do you
            know so much about the wood here? Is it common in Lakia?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Oh, no. It is mostly used by the Pocotcotco people. They use the
            rule this whole continent and this wood was used where ever there
            was large amounts of undead. I was just here because I found a
            record of this place and wanted to explore during my time off. Did
            not expect to see anyone else out here." He replied as we moved into
            a jungle. The door was in the side of a cliff face surrounded by
            green and trees.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I had no idea they used to rule the whole continent! But there is
            defiantly a boat load of undead down there!" I exclaimed.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Erm, maybe you have not yet started history classes perhaps? All
            students learn about this during education even in Alden." He
            replied as we walked back to a small camp he had made just 10m from
            the cliff face.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Ah yeah, I think we start history classes next term, they are
            easing us into the changes in our lives." I said unsure myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Mmm I guess it is a big change from the villages. I bet you will be
            too busy to go out like this any time soon then. Problem now is you
            are a first year alone outside of the academy, I sure know you did
            not come here alone. Where are your friends?" He asked his tone
            turning somber.
          </p>

          <p>
            "As far as I know either dead or undead. I need to get back to the
            academy, but I am in to state to do so."
          </p>

          <p>
            "You can come back with me, I have the party skill so I should be
            able to keep you alive." He replied.
          </p>

          <p>"Don't you have work here to do?" I asked.</p>

          <p>
            "Not work, like I said I was just exploring during my time off. Plus
            the reward for taking you back safe is more then I will gain here."
            He said.
          </p>

          <p>"Reward?" I asked.</p>

          <p>
            "You think they won't reward me? With the information about a tomb
            you are bringing back instead of all of you being wiped out and the
            information being lost is worth a reward I think. It's early morning
            so unless you need to rest we can head off now the journey should
            take a few days." He said grabbing some of his things near by.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I just want to get away from this tomb. What ever is down there I
            want nothing to do with it." I replied honestly. We set off soon
            after back for the academy.
