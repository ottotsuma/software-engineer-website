          <h4>The fifth day.</h4>
          <p>
            Entering the armory again, I debated on which weapon to pick. This
            time the other students in the armory where curious about what I
            would chose. Trying to ignore their stares by telling myself this is
            just 5 minutes of fame, they will all forget about me soon enough. I
            picked up a warhammer, the thing was easily 30kg, no mage in the
            right mind would use such a weapon, no normal mage could even wield
            such a thing. Smiling to myself internally with and idea of how to
            act in this battle I took my place and waited.
          </p>

          <p>"Otto & Kaja make your way to the arena."</p>

          <p>
            Kaja was a little shorter then me, dark blonde hair and dark blue
            eyes, but the most noticeable thing about her was a large wooden
            shield in her left hand.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "How did you know you would be fighting me?"</p>

          <p>
            Kaja - "I didn't just figured some other punk would try it, if I
            don't need it I can drop it if I do need I got it. Although that is
            not a spear." she pointed to the warhammer balanced on my shoulder.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "No, no it is not" I replied with a smile.</p>

          <p>
            We made our way into the arena, bowed to each other and the match
            started. Kaja kept her wand hidden behind the shield and when she
            casted fireballs she moved the shield and released them at me, I was
            trying my best to avoid them entirely. Taunting me as he danced and
            dodged. "You'll have to fight back pretty boy or I'll burn your hair
            off."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Stop shotting me and I might" I replied moving aside of yet another
            fireball, while I was saving mana my stamina would not last much
            longer. Using 'Charged Charge' I dashed across the field and slammed
            my warhammer into Kaja's shield, although it helped she struggled
            under the force and fell down. The shield had reduced the attack
            from 72% of her hp to just damaging 34%, it would take 3 attacks to
            take her down instead of 2. While down but not out, Kaja shot a
            fireball into my stomach. -25% health. Good thing she keeps using
            fireball and nothing else. I moved to swing my warhammer again, this
            time without 'Charged Charge' I resorted to using shocking touch but
            he only managed 28% of her health. Kaja struck back with a
            flamethrower spell putting all of my clothes on fire. Dropping and
            rolling away I lost my warhammer on the ground to put out the fire,
            -25% again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kaja - "What will you do now, without your toy? Time to become ash
            and smoke." Kaja raised her wand and the ground started to burn, my
            feet started to sweat, she was going to set me on fire from below
            this time. Too far away to hit her with anything useful all my
            spells only have 1m range. 'Chain-Lightning'. I struck the warhammer
            on the ground with 'Chain-Lightning', the lightning hit the
            warhammer and the chain part bounced into Kaja -14%, that sudden
            shock and pain caused her to lose concentration and I took my chance
            and dashed for my hammer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grabbing the warhammer I felt a sudden burning sessions in my side,
            -28%. She hit me with another one of those damned fireballs. I
            Screamed loudly as I turned to use 'Charged Charge' I accelerated,
            Kaja seeing this coming enveloped herself in fire-mana as I slammed
            my warhammer down into her shield, the fire mana had increased her
            defences, 22% damage. Thinking to myself if she was level 14 or less
            she would be dead. -35%. The fire cloak had stuck me as he came into
            melee range, my health had reached the final 10 first, my blow had
            landed moments after leaving her with 2% hp. I had lost.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reflecting on the battle, she must of been at least level 15, would
            of put her hp at 250 unless she put any points into vitality in
            which case she might be a lower level. Unable to do anything about
            it now the reflection was a form of self improvement rather then an
            excuse for my loss, I would reflect on what happened, what I should
            of done and grow from this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bowing to Kaja, and her to me, we left the arena and returned our
            weapons, it was nice to not have been knocked out this time. walking
            back to watch the rest of the duels though the day I got an
            unexpected visit from Lubin my teacher.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lubin - "Rather interesting approach, Strength in a match between
            mages."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Did not think that would slip by you, do you disapprove?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Lubin - "No not really, I trust you have read though the histories
            at least once? You are not the first mage to try strength and magic.
            I'm sure you won't be the last but it is very uncommon during peace
            times."
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Why is it uncommon during times of peace?"</p>

          <p>
            Lubin - "The method of strength and magic is one usually only taken
            after level 50, to do it so early would only happen when you have
            many types of enemies, a hard road before level 50 mind you. I just
            came to give some advice, Histories: Battle-Mages, Fighter-Mage,
            Inquisitor, Mage-Tanks are all a good place to start. There are more
            however, slightly more unusual methods. In the main library there is
            also records from a Necromancer and a Deathknight. Not usually given
            out to first year students, but usual first year students don't put
            points into strength."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Thank you sir! But why would you go out of your way to do
            all this for me?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Lubin - "Nothing personal, it's just my job. Guide students to a
            path that they want to take, once they find their path help them
            traverse it. Don't mistake this for me picking favorites I am just
            doing what is expected of me. You may take your leave for the day if
            you want, I believe you have some reading to do."
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "Yes sir, thank you sir!" With new knowledge I went to the
            library while the other first year students where in the arena to
            read up on the necromancer and the deathknight.{" "}
