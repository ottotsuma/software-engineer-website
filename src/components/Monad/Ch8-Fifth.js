          {/* 30kg warhammer... ? */}
          <p>
            Entering the armory again, I debated on which weapon to pick. This
            time the other students in the armory where curious about what I
            would chose. Trying to ignore their stares, by telling myself this
            is just five minutes of fame, they will all forget about me soon
            enough. I picked up a warhammer, the thing was easily over half of
            my own weight, no mage in the right mind would use such a weapon, no
            normal mage could even wield such a thing. Smiling to myself with
            and idea of how to act in this battle, I took my place and waited.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a short wait an older student near the arena entrance shouted
            out. "Otto & Kaja make your way to the arena."
          </p>

          <p>
            Kaja was a little shorter then me, dark blonde hair and dark blue
            eyes, but the most noticeable thing about her was a large wooden
            shield in her left hand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thinking about it I asked. "How did you know you would be fighting
            me?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I didn't, just figured some other punk would try it. If I don't
            need it I can drop it, if I do need I got it. Although that is not a
            spear." she pointed to the warhammer balanced on my shoulder.
          </p>

          <p>"No, no it is not" I replied with a smile.</p>

          <p>
            We made our way into the arena, bowed to each other and the match
            started. Kaja kept her wand hidden behind the shield and when she
            casted fireballs she moved the shield to the side and released them
            at me. I was trying my best to avoid them entirely. "You'll have to
            fight back pretty boy or I'll burn your hair off." She taunted me.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Stop shooting me and I might" I replied moving aside of yet another
            fireball. While I was saving mana my stamina would not last much
            longer. Using 'Charged Charge' I dashed across the field and slammed
            my warhammer into Kaja's shield. Although the shield helped, she
            struggled under the force and fell to one knee. The shield had
            reduced the attack from dealing 72% of her hp to just 34%, it would
            take 3 attacks to take her down instead of 2. While down, but not
            out, Kaja shot a fireball into my stomach. -25% health. Good thing
            she keeps using fireball and nothing else I thought to myself. I
            moved back to swing my warhammer again, this time without 'Charged
            Charge', I resorted to using shocking touch but I only managed 28%
            of her health. Kaja struck back with a flamethrower spell putting
            all of my clothes on fire. Dropping and rolling away I lost my
            warhammer on the ground trying to put out the fire, -33%.
          </p>

          <p>
            "What will you do now without your toy? Time to become ash and
            smoke." Kaja taunted raising her wand. The ground started to burn,
            my feet started to sweat, she was going to set me on fire from below
            this time! Too far away to hit her with anything useful all my
            spells only have range of a few paces. 'Chain-Lightning'. I struck
            the warhammer on the ground with 'Chain-Lightning', the lightning
            hit the warhammer and the chain part bounced into Kaja -14%, that
            sudden shock and pain caused her to lose concentration and I took my
            chance and dashed for my hammer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grabbing the warhammer I felt a sudden burning sessions in my side,
            -20%. She hit me with another one of those damned fireballs. I
            Screamed loudly as I turned to use 'Charged Charge'. I accelerated,
            Kaja seeing me coming enveloped herself in fire-mana as I slammed my
            warhammer down into her shield, the fire mana had increased her
            defenses, she took 22% damage. I took -35% from the flames she was
            wrapped in. The fire cloak had stuck me as I came into melee range,
            my health had reached the final 10 points first, my blow had landed
            moments after leaving her with 2% hp. I had lost.
          </p>
          {/* here */}
          <p>
            Reflecting on the battle, she must of been at least level 15. That
            would of put her hp at around 250, unless she put any points into
            vitality in which case she might be a lower level. Unable to do
            anything about it now, the reflection was a form of self improvement
            rather then an excuse for my loss. I would reflect on what happened,
            what I should of done and grow from this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bowing to Kaja, and her to me, we left the arena and returned our
            weapons, it was nice to not have been knocked out this time. I
            walked back to watch the rest of the duels, although I got an
            unexpected visit from Lubin my teacher.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Rather interesting approach, putting points into Strength as a
            mage." Lubin commented.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I see it did not slip by you completely, do you disapprove?" I
            asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "No not really, I trust you have read through the histories at least
            once? You are not the first mage to try strength and magic. I'm sure
            you won't be the last but it is very uncommon during peace times."
            He replied.
          </p>

          <p>
            Confused by his comment I asked "Why is it uncommon during times of
            peace?"
          </p>

          <p>
            "The method of strength and magic is one usually only taken after
            level 50, to do it so early would only happen when you have no
            choice. Since most jobs require mages to have high magic and not
            strength. Anyway I just came to give some advice. Histories:
            Battle-Mages, Fighter-Mage, Inquisitor, Mage-Tanks are all a good
            place to start. There are more however, their methods are slightly
            more unusual. In the main library there is also records from a
            Necromancer and a Deathknight. Not usually given out to first year
            students, but usual first year students don't put points into
            strength." He chuckled as he stood up wishing me luck.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Thank you sir! But why would you go out of your way to do all this
            for me?" I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Nothing personal, it's just my job. Guide students to a path that
            they want to take, once they find their path help them traverse it.
            Don't mistake this for me picking favorites, I am just doing what is
            expected of me. You may take your leave for the day if you want, I
            believe you have some reading to do." He smiled and made to leave.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yes sir, thank you sir!" With new knowledge I went to the library
            while the other first year students where in the arena to read up on
            the necromancer and the deathknight.
