            "Now who can tell me what separates a Mage from a Fighter? In
            particular how they use their mana." The teacher asked to the class.
            His name was Lubin, he was my teacher for combat classes and general
            magic. Unlike some of the other teachers who where researchers or
            third year students Lubin was a full time teacher at the academy.
            His job was to write the curriculum for the magic classes taught to
            all students so he naturally taught that class as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would had three classes this year. Magic, Combat and our element.
            While there might be minor events or one time classes this meant
            this year I would only have 2 teachers. I had yet to meet my other
            teacher but I was glad to have Lubin so far he seemed like a
            professional teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            "They project their mana into the world around them to cause change"
            One of the students answered while I was thinking about the
            introduction to the school we had just finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good answer. You should all already know that having read chapter 1
            of MM&M. Mages channel the mana inside their bodies into the world
            in the form of spells." Lubin replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Todays lesson is about getting you all understanding the directions
            you can take as a Mage. The kind of jobs you can get in Alden and
            beyond. Since all of you here are taking the combat class this will
            give you an idea of the jobs you can get as a warrior-mage. And
            finally where to put your stat points." Lubin said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We will start with a brief look at the common elements mages have
            and maybe a few specific to nobel families of Alden. Before moving
            onto common jobs. Turn to chapter 2 in MM&M." Lubin said as he wrote
            down the names and symbols of the elements on a board behind him
            with chalk.

            "Each element has a set of spells that come with it. These elements
            behind me are common elements found though the whole continent. If
            we focus on earth for example, spells might include defensive spells
            like earth wall, offensive spells like earth spike or non-combat
            spells like soften." Lubin said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Which spells you pick up, how you use them, makes every earth mage
            different in some way. While this has its advantages, such as being
            versatile. The flip side is the army. They provide a manual to all
            students wanting to join them, this way they can have uniform mages.
            This makes forming regiments easier for the army because they do not
            have to match unique variants together to bring out their best. They
            had taken lessons from history and picked out what works best for
            them. Most earth mages in the army have earth wall for example, high
            as possible. Without earth wall you could not join the military as a
            standard earth mage." Lubin continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Looking at Alden's unique elements most are with the nobel
            families. As you may know most nobel families of Alden come from the
            fighters line. There are few mages found within their families.
            However the city of Alden's very own the Grand Duke has royal
            lightning, it is purple in color and has not been seen outside of
            their family. Argavereri's Viscount uses a green smoke element, most
            unusual. Finally baron Mann based at Soldenheim famously uses
            runes." Lubin explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            "While I did not mention the witches of the witches coven, we should
            all know about them after all. The witch of Alden, founder of this
            country, was apart of the same coven. However those magics are
            taught to any women who joins and not held by one family." Lubin
            explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then split into small groups to look though the histories book
            and asked to match up as many persons in the book to the jobs found
            in Alden. This would help us get familiar with the histories book,
            some of the people inside and the jobs found in Alden all at the
            same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lesson went on for another 25 minutes like this before being
            asked to present our findings in small groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now lets look at how to invest your stat points. Firstly, Magic
            affects the total amount of MP you have, so that is usually the main
            stat for Mages. Even if you plan to be a front line fighter, healer
            or non-combatant." Lubin said after the class had come back to watch
            him lecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            "For the other stat points & spell points we have provided you a
            book containing what past mages have done and how it worked out for
            them. You can either copy one of them or just learn from what they
            did and make your own path. Unless you want to join the military
            directly." Lubin followed up with.
          </p>

          <p>
            "If there are any questions, you will be seeing me once a day, four
            days a week, so please wait until you have read though 'Exemplary
            mages: a history' before asking questions. As you might find your
            answers in there." Lubin said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shortly after the class was dismissed. I went to the library along
            with many of the other students from my class and other first year
            classes. The main library was split into sections. First years could
            only access the first floor which soon became packed. I couldn't see
            a good place to sit with students everywhere. I had the book I
            needed with me anyway it's not like I had to use the library to
            study so I went back to the cliffside.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the library on the cliffside I got to reading the histories under
            one of the large stone pillars with light coming out from it. After
            reading though so many of the Mages from the past I soon found
            myself bored and looking for anything else to distract me. I started
            looking along the spines of the old books around the library; 'Fire
            Magic', 'Faming with mana - Pocotcotcan magic', 'Lusty Ma...', 'The
            Summoner: Morian Zenas'. "Oh he's in the histories book, wonder if
            it's different". I said a loud, clearly the studying was driving me
            mad.
          </p>

          <p>
            After reading and comparing the book to the pages for awhile I
            concluded that the people that wrote the histories just copied
            directly from these older books. Cutting out the stories and reasons
            why they made their decisions and just wrote down the outcomes and
            stats.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decied to look for some other books to see if any about
            shock-mages which where also used by the military. I was going to
            get the military manual later anyway because I want to join after I
            leave the academy. I think it is my best bet at a starting job.
            There were some in the histories but they had clearly clean out a
            lot of information the old books had.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found a book half on its side, 'Otto Magnus Of Might'. The name
            was so bad. Curious, I opened the book to find the pages had been
            cut cleanly in the middle. Inside the book was a black key, and the
            number 304. Below it, drawn onto the bottom of the book cover was
            strange makings, markings similar to the door shown to me by Tisiel
            during my first day. The key looked to be similar to the one to my
            room.
          </p>
          {/* Here */}
          <p>
            This took no expert to figure out, no one had been into this library
            for a long time, the person who made that door must of lived in room
            34 at sometime. If someone lives there now I will just have to be
            quick and use my wand of magic detection to see if there is anything
            there. Making my way to the room on the 3rd floor I pressed my ear
            up against it, no sound. Taking a deep breath I put the key into the
            door and turned it, click. I pushed the door open and sitting there
            looking back at me was Tisiel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "Breaking into a ladies room without even knocking what
            kind of man are you?"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Wait I can explain!"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "What you gonna tell me you found a book in the old library
            with strange symbols similar to the door?"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Yes?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ahahaha, it is my book, can't believe how quickly that
            worked you picked up the book with your own name on... Otto the
            mighty mage? really?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Hey it's not like the other mages had normal names and how
            did you know I would go to the old library and look though the books
            anyway?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Truthfully I didn't just took a chance to see if you where
            interested in the door or knew anything about it, thats why I showed
            you around. No one else has taken any real interest in it. So do you
            want to know whats behind the door?"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Well, yeah"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Well come in, and give me my key back. There was a book in
            that old library with strange signs on like the door that I found
            weeks before your arrival, I managed to decipher some of it and it
            took me to one of the ruins just north of here, looked like an old
            part of the academy that had fell into disuse or something happened
            to it. Anyway hidden inside was this ring."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel places a small dark grey ring down on the table, with the
            strange signs all over it glowing dimly red.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "You did all that already? What does the ring do?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yes well, my specialty is deciphering old texts and
            charms"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "How do you already have a specialty..."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "My parents do this sort of thing, they decipher old
            languages, magic texts, relics and items. Also.. I am level 12 so I
            already picked my element."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Don't remember reading about the decipher element but I am
            not going to lie that sounds cool"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "My element isn't called decipher, whatever I will just
            wait till you unlock your elements. The ring it's self though. Does
            nothing that I can figure out."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "So when you say help, do you want me to try to and find what
            the ring does? help you read the text?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Ah the help I need is well, do you have the skill Tether?
            It's just I can't learn it.."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Used all your points?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel nods in response. "But I also will need help going here" She
            holds out a badly drawn map and points to a grave yard. "There is a
            chance we might be attacked so if I have you there... As long as I
            can outrun you they will be busy eating you while I get away. Deal?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I'll learn tether, and maybe some other spells to help us
            KILL our opponents not run away."
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I mean, as long as I get to live."</p>
          <p>Otto - "When are we going?"</p>
          <p>Titles - "I'll meet you out front in 5."</p>
          <p>Otto - "... Yeah alright."</p>

          <p>
            Tisiel - "You can't put more points in then the level you are,
            points for items and your titles go on top of that."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I see, then, I am not sure what other stats to get."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah, fighters have it easier, strength and either
            vitality or dexterity. For me I picked Magic and Sense, since I want
            to be an explorer."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Makes sense, I should pick vitality, endurance, willpower,

          <p>Tisiel - "Lets just go, you can pick on the way."</p>
          <p>
            Walking up north of the cliffs away from the academy the path soon
            becomes more dirt then stone, unused in so long. About 40 minutes
            later we arrive at the ruins of what could of been a small campus,
            it was hard to tell what it was with only the foundations of the
            buildings surviving.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "This where you found the ring?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Yeah, the grave yard was built outside of town though, I
            would of gone alone but, well you will see."
          </p>

          <p>
            Arriving before the grave yard the pair stare blankly forward. 10
            meter black metal spikes raised from the ground placed close to each
            other too small for a person to pass though, with an eerie ghost
            like gas passing between the spikes.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Take it there is no gate?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Nope. This erm, wall is the problem I have."</p>
          <p>Otto - "And how will tether solve your problems?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Well, according to this book the ring has to be placed on
            that erm alter? inside the grave yard to prove you belong to the
            society."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "The alter is half a meter behind the bars, surely you can
            just place it on with your hand"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "I mean, if you want to put your hand into and though that
            gas, I won't stop you."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "... It's corrosive isn't it?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Very." Tisiel kicks a rock into the gas and it disappears
            before it can reach the other side.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Amazing, and the ring won't dissolve?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "If it does, it is the end of this mystery, but it
            shouldn't".
          </p>

          <p>
            With a shake of my head I picked up the ring from Tisiel's hand and
            placed it on my own. I then pushed my mana though the tip of his
            finger and it came out like a rope. Attaching the ring to the end of
            the rope like tether, it stuck when I willed it to grab the ring.
            Pushing the tethered ring into the gas I was surprised when nothing
            happened, pushing it past the bars and out and placing it on the
            alter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking at each other, the bars shoot into the ground in an instant
            and the gas dissipates. Behind is left grave stones, grass and a
            small stone mausoleum in the middle.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "Ladies first."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Get moving you coward."</p>

          <p>Otto - "No zombies, surprising."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Don't jinx it."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Grab the ring?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "On the way out, same method or we die."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Glad I asked..."</p>

          <p>
            Opening the door and looking around inside, the pair see nothing,
            it's dark so we cast mage light, mana gathers in the palm of their
            hands and gives off a small blue glow.
          </p>

          <p>Otto - "This is the light from the cliffside."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Yeah I mean, it's a common and useful spell."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Ah"</p>
          <p>
            Inside was three stone boxes, the length and width of a man. On top
            of each of the boxes carved from stone was the sculpture of two
            woman and a man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "Sarcophagus, Alden nobles are buried like this even
            today."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "I did not know that. Our dead are buried in the village."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "We burn ours. Since you took money from a dead girl
            before, guess you won't mind breaking open some ones resting place?"
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I don't mind, but you make me sound like a bad guy..."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel just smiled as she crouched down opened the book and started
            reading and marking her fingers along the signs on the stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pushing the stone lids to one side in the first I found a skeleton
            of a woman, probably the woman who was carved on top. Prying the
            rings from her fingers and the necklace from her finally I took the
            tiara from her head. Tisiel looked up at me as I removed items from
            a grave with a strange look.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "I remember this being your idea, you might need them"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel just rolled her eyes and went back to studying the signs
            around the sarcophaguses. In the second was the skeleton of a man, a
            wand, crown and one ring. The third contained another woman, jewelry
            and one coin. Making small pile of loot on the ground I turned to
            Tisiel.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Learn anything?"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "I will have to keep coming here to read these, but the
            words I think I understand, he is a king, she was a queen and the
            second woman was his daughter."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "They died at the same time?"</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "No real evidence of that. Let's see what you found."</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel looked though the items before deciding she had no idea which
            where important and which where not.
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Look away for a moment."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Why?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "Secret."</p>
          <p>Tisiel - "Fine, but no funny stuff."</p>
          <p>Otto - "Like I would..."</p>
          <p>
            I took out my wand and passed mana though it before placing it back,
            I then moved the crown, wand and the kings ring to one side. The
            Queens tiara & ring. The daughters coin. "You can look again"
          </p>
          <p>Tisiel - "I had to wait for you to make two piles?"</p>
          <p>Otto - "The ones in this pile contain magic, these don't"</p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "I won't ask how but it would be amazing if they still
            contain magic, It must of been centuries since anyone came here.
            Let's get them all back I can use my skills to decipher these items
            and tell you what they all do."
          </p>
          <p>Otto - "Sure, let's put them in your bag, keep them safe."</p>

          <p>
            When we step outside the mausoleum some of the stone statues carved
            on the graves or around the mausoleum fell apart. One managed to
            maintain some of its form and runs towards us, we split up and ran,
            seeing the stone golem running after Tisiel I slowed down and
            decided to double back and help.
          </p>

          <p>
            Running up to the golem I cast 'Strike' and the weak golem became
            enraged but the mana that struck down from above him had almost tore
            his arm off. "Tisiel, Strike it." Tisiel turned and thew a ball of
            mana into it. One arm broke off and seeing that manaball can be used
            as a weapon, I joined in and created a ball of mana in the palm of
            my hand and slammed it into the golem. Under the bombardment soon
            the golem fell apart with a creepy cry of anguish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto - "They must of all been guardians, for them to be so weak.
            Some of them even broke apart when activated."
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "More impressive that they even activated, but that could
            help us determine the age of this place."
          </p>
          <p>
            Otto - "Been meaning to ask, if it has been here so long, don't you
            think someone else would of opened the door by now, or know what it
            was or what this graveyard is?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Tisiel - "It's possible, but the fun is in the discovery. Now get
            the ring with tether and let's leave before something else comes to
            life."
          </p>

          <p>
            Tisiel practically locked herself in her room for a few days, only
            coming out to go to lessons and eat. I went to check on her
            everyday, it was amazing at the speed she deciphered at considering
            she had to make time for her normal studies.
